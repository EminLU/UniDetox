Diamond explains that Trump's decision to fire FBI Director James Comey was one of his biggest mistakes and the only time in his presidency that Trump's actions were criticized so much.

The Republic Navy was the military force of the Republic, the successor state of the Old Republic that lasted for several thousand years from approximately 3000 BBY to 100 ABY, during which the galaxy was ravaged by war between the Old Republic and the resurgent Sith Empire. In its early history, the Navy served as a centralized military organization, though its primary goal was to ensure the Republic's defense of the Republic. Following the death of Emperor Palpatine, the Senate was left in the hands of the High Council, a council dominated by the Dark Council members.

"The University of Sydney's most recent ""Selfie with Professor"" exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art featured the university's iconic statue of its founder Sir Robert Menzies, which sits at the intersection of two streets named after the school's founders, Sir George and Sir Robert. The Menzies statue, which depicts Sir Robert, standing proudly alongside a horse and holding his hand, is now on the move. The statue's journey began with an artist-designed installation, where a specially designed motorcycle was used to ride on the statue, before being towed off. But a recent Facebook post by the Sydney University Student Association (SUAS), which is running the exhibition, revealed that the statue had been removed, apparently for its ""potential safety"" concerns. The university is not commenting, and the SUAS is reportedly seeking clarification.

In response, a spokesperson from the Menzies Society told Sydney.com.au:

The University of Sydney has informed us that it removed the Menzies statue on Sunday, 25 February. It will remain in storage until it is re-erected and, as it has no permanent installation, it will remain in the Gallery for now. It was a mistake on our part not to have installed it before and"

"In an attempt to stem the flow of illegal aliens crossing into the country from the Rio Grande Valley, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has released a video encouraging illegal border crossers to return to Mexico or make another attempt to enter the country.

""I understand the apprehension of some who cross into the U.S. illegally from the border area in south Texas,"" ICE Acting Director Thomas Homan said in a press release. ""It is imperative that they be apprehended, processed and returned home, which we have begun doing. However, the recent increase in cross-border criminal activity from Mexico and the border region of Arizona, California and Texas has made the situation more complex.""

"A federal court on Monday ordered the state to release information about its medical marijuana program in a lawsuit that could set the stage for more suits challenging the program.

A judge in New Orleans ruled the state has to comply with a request by a marijuana activist seeking more information about its medical marijuana program, saying the program violates federal law.

In the ruling, the judge ordered the state to release documents detailing how much of the $20 million in annual cannabis revenue the program brings in, the number of people participating in it and whether any patients are using cannabis as medicine.

The request in a lawsuit filed last year was the first by anyone challenging the state's program. The state has argued the information would violate the Drug Enforcement Administration's restrictions on sharing confidential information on drug-related cases.

The DEA did not respond to a request for comment on Monday's ruling.

Louisiana, along with several other states, allows the use of medical marijuana for certain patients with debilitating medical conditions, but not recreational marijuana use.

The judge found the state has ""unjustified reasons"" for withholding information on how much of the cannabis program's revenues are flowing back to the state. He ordered the state to turn over all the data within 60 days,"

"The P-Series has a distinctive shape that combines a distinctive form and an iconic form factor.

The P-series is designed with a highly-rigid titanium-alloy fuselage with a two-stage titanium structure supporting the airframe, stabilator and wing root. The aircraft has a titanium main gear system.

The fuselage features a wing-tip and a rear spar which provide good control surfaces for low speeds, low altitude performance, and long-range cruise and strike capability.

The rear spar has an internal high-speed shock absorber to reduce vibration in high-speed flight and to improve stability during the initial climb phase of flight.

The titanium fuselage incorporates the pilot and crew cabin.

"A federal appeals court has dismissed an antitrust case against Apple. The court found that the federal agency's theory of ""deceptive acts"" was too narrow to meet the legal requirements for a valid claim against a tech giant. The decision will have a big impact on other cases filed against tech giants by antitrust enforcers.

Apple had argued that its software patents are entitled to protection under the doctrine of patent exhaustion. Patent exhaustion, in this case, would have meant that once an alleged patent infringed by Apple was issued, it could not be enforced for five years, and so no more lawsuits could be brought against Apple until it paid up. The Federal Circuit, in a ruling released on Thursday, ruled against this.

In short, the court ruled that a patent-licensing agreement that doesn't expressly include the right to assert an infringement suit until the patent's expiration can be legally enforceable, but only if the company making the software actually holds the patents. In Apple's case, the software patents in question were filed by Sun Microsystems.

A San Diego mayor has issued an order for an investigation after she was approached by an investment firm seeking a $150,000 contribution to support the city's ballot measure to allow for casino gambling in her city.

The city of San Diego was contacted by an investment company offering to put money towards the campaign to overturn a referendum vote against casinos in November, Mayor Ivy Taylor told NBC 7 on Monday.

She said the mayor's chief of staff had spoken with the city attorney, and that the matter had been reviewed.

The company offering the contribution is not associated with any casino developer in San Diego or Las Vegas, and Taylor said it would not be possible to make the contribution without approval from her administration.

"The top two candidates in the race for the GOP nomination, Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, have said they won't be able to get through a GOP presidential primary without a major effort to reform the U.S. immigration system. But some prominent conservatives who have long backed comprehensive immigration reform are questioning the need to be so specific in their stance on immigration reform.

The two Republicans — Bush and Rubio — have said that if they get to the White House they will sign an executive order on immigration and push Congress to enact that plan. Bush's and Rubio's comments, coupled with the Republican presidential race being crowded, have been cited by many Republicans as an example of how they want the field to expand, which will only add fuel to their debate.

In an interview with conservative talk-show host Laura Ingraham this week, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, a fierce proponent of immigration reform, said the current political situation would be an ideal time for an executive action. ""The way we need to change is through an executive action. We need to act. I believe this is a moment that is going to come,"" Romney told Ingraham.

"It was only a matter of time.

With a little less than a year to go before the U.S. election, Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, is already accusing the country's most senior judge of bias.

Judge Gonzalo Curiel, of the federal court in Southern California, was born in Indiana.

Trump has suggested Curiel, who was born in Indiana and who is of Mexican-American descent, is biased because of the fact he was born in Indiana. Trump says that his plan for the country will be different from that of President Obama.

The judge's remarks during an interview on a Mexican television show about the proposed border wall were cited by Trump on Thursday, in what appears to be a warning shot at the judge's Hispanic heritage.

The Republican nominee tweeted:

The judge is an Obama pick, which is great. I want people that love the law and love our country. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 6, 2016

In the same interview with Univision's Jorge Ramos, Curiel also criticized the idea of a border wall between the United States and Mexico as impractical, and he questioned the idea of deporting all undocumented immigrants.

Councilmembers John A. Fenton, Herb Wesson, and Joe Buscaino also joined Englander in speaking to reporters.

The press conference, held on a cold and overcast Monday morning, came at a time of growing grief for the LGBT community in Los Angeles, with dozens of gay couples who have been married in the city in the last month killed or injured by violence or hate-based hate crimes.

Councilmembers Fenton and Wesson are members of a commission set up to help promote tolerance in the community and make the city a better place to live, work, and visit.

The film, ""The Secret of NIMH"" — a short for ""Nimona's Secret of the Missing"" — will be screened in New Hampshire and other states as part of a campaign by a local television station to bring the original television series back.

"""He had an affinity for the way I thought about things.""

When we sat down with Michael Douglas and Julianne Moore on the red carpet at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscars party in May, they both spoke about the process of directing their latest movie, The Theory of Everything. The conversation focused on what Moore, a native New Yorker, described as a ""different way"" of thinking about filmmaking that they hadn't previously been exposed to.

Moore began the conversation with an explanation of her personal background. She grew up in New Jersey, in a strict household in the shadow of New York City, with a father who worked in advertising, and two younger sisters. As Moore recalled it, ""It was an extremely hard upbringing, and the pressure of the household, the pressure of being raised, of having a job and being able to pay your way, the pressure of all that. The only place to really escape was acting, and it's such a competitive environment to get to. And that's the one way that you escape.""

The fact that Moore grew up with three siblings and three different mothers (and her first and last name being Moore, and not Moore, Moore) led to some conflict throughout her life, including her decision to quit school."

"If you want to be a leader of your team or team at all, then you have to know your people.

A team needs people to work together in a cohesive and effective way. In a team setting, leaders must know what it means to work well together. In other words, they have to know the people that are part of your team and their expectations, which can lead to problems when the leaders try to solve the problem by their own means.

When leaders fail to know the people around them, they tend to make decisions without looking at their needs or expectations. And when that happens, it leads to friction in your team.

I recently talked about a company with an issue of friction when one of its teams was made aware that they would have to take a decision on their project. The problem? The leaders of the team knew the problem was the product team and wanted to be made aware of it, but didn't want to talk to them. The solution was simple, however:

When a project has to be solved, talk to everyone who will have an influence on the solution, including the project manager and the team lead.

But what I'm seeing in terms of how we can integrate that into the gameplay and what I'm hearing from players, they are very, very excited by this concept.

""There's been some people that have asked why is that on this side of the map. But if we have an idea that the other team might use, why wouldn't we use that too? So, if we are doing things that the other team doesn't know about, why would it make any sense to make it on our side of the map?""

WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump on Saturday will announce plans to overhaul the U.S. tax system, according to a White House official who asked not to be identified to discuss the plan publicly.

The announcement, expected around 8 a.m., is likely to include the president's plans for lowering the corporate tax rate and to create a new tax credit for workers.

"We've had some really fun conversations here in the blog over the years with other parents and with other professionals on parenting and family life, but I'm here to bring you something a little bit more personal.

This week, we were in the middle of our third child. When he was a baby, we decided to keep him for the first three years, after which he'd have a ""mother"" of sorts to look after him, a name we didn't quite know how to pronounce. It's a name we had been searching for a long time and, having been to a few different birthplaces and gone on the Internet for inspiration, we settled on our chosen name for our little man.

After that, it was a lot of hard work in the beginning.

"""There are some things we don't know. We have no idea if a drug could cause that,"" said Dr. Michael Rosenfeld, chief of neurosurgery at Stony Brook University, who has treated some patients.

Doctors can take measures to try to avoid the possibility. Patients may have a drug-induced psychotic break to ease them before surgery. But some drugs have caused psychotic breaks before surgery.

One of them is clozapine, the anticonvulsant that has been associated with about 100 cases of suicide since 2000, according to Dr. Paul J. Thomas, an associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh who studies drug-induced suicide. Clozapine was approved for severe schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but was recently re-classified by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe depression.

Clozapine can cause psychotic symptoms and seizures. The most common symptom, known as catatonia, occurs after taking too much, Dr. Thomas said, but other symptoms are less well known, including delusions.

As you know, Alan Greenspan is the chairman of the Federal Reserve. And the ""we"" in question are the U.S. citizens, or the taxpayers.

A recent report by the Congressional Research Service states, ""The Federal Government, under current law, does not collect income tax from any U.S. citizens or residents, and thus is unable to provide any government benefit that it would not provide to U.S. citizens or residents if the income of the noncitizen was reported.

"The main reason why I would say this book was better than The Name of the Rose is because of how different the author was. This time it's not an author with a great imagination. Rather, it is an author who was a master at telling stories of how we treat others and what happens when we treat them poorly. The Name of the Rose had the best story lines I have ever seen. In the beginning the book is just an account of what happened between two men who are at each other's throats, but I feel like it is not the same with The Last Policeman.

This book is a novel about two very different men. In the first part we have the narrator of the story. This narrator is called the police officer who is not in fact the one who committed the murder. He is simply the one who witnessed the crime, which was not what the victim said. The story begins when the police officer finds a corpse of a young girl on the shore of a small island in the Baltic sea. He then gets his car stolen, which makes him a wanted man, and is pursued by two people, both of whom have the same name, ""Dumoulin"" (I don't know what he is, I didn't read the"
"The idea that you should take the time to be yourself and enjoy yourself is a common theme throughout all types of media. When you look at movies and TV shows, it's easy to see this theme represented as the hero in each and every character's life.

Unfortunately, when we take that to an extreme, the world often comes to an end.

What you might have experienced if you're not familiar is the scenario of an ""anti-hero."" The term has been used for quite some time to describe a character that has some flaws in their life and who does not try to make the best out of their circumstances.

While they are not as extreme in terms of their flaws as they could be, they often have some very dark traits that often are a sign that something is not quite right with them.

Let's take a look at a few examples to help you better understand this idea:

"""If we were going to get something out of it, we would be willing to make the trade.""

It was an unspoken conversation during a conversation on the phone with former general manager Bob Myers during the trade deadline last year. The Giants, who had been struggling to put together a roster that was more than just a collection of aging veterans, were in desperate need of some younger, cheap, young talent. They'd made several trades for veterans that were more about filling out their 40-man roster, rather than bringing in young talent that might add up to something better down the road.

When Myers called the trade, he told me, ""I have a guy who fits what we need,"" referring to first baseman Brandon Belt.

It wasn't an easy deal for the Giants to make, and the one that Myers struck was not exactly a ""sure thing,"" according to general manager Brian Sabean. It took three months for the two sides to iron out some of the particulars and settle on a package for the 24-year-old. It took three months, and several players and meetings with various front office executives before it all fell into place, but it finally was all there. The Giants received a player that could play multiple positions and make"
"The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) announced Monday it was investigating a viral video in which an LAPD officer was caught on tape firing several shots at a moving car while trying to detain its occupants. The LAPD also said it would look into a separate incident where a bystander was shot during an apparent attempt at self-defense by a man.

In the latest video to be shared online, posted on Tuesday morning, an LAPD officer was seen pursuing the vehicle while flashing his emergency lights at the vehicle, which was seen fleeing from a traffic stop. As the car pulled onto the shoulder of a major highway, a passenger in the backseat jumped out and began to run toward the car.

""Hey!"" a woman yelled out as she chased the fleeing suspect, according to a copy of the video obtained by ABC News.

As the man reached the passenger door, he was shot multiple times by a Los Angeles police officer, who was seen firing his gun as he fired his weapon, police said.

The unidentified man, who is described in a copy of the video obtained by ABC News by the LA Times as being between 25 and 35 years old, was hospitalized with a gunshot wound to the leg and released the next day. The woman who had"
"It is now widely recognized that a strong positive association between a high consumption of fish, including wild-caught species, and a lower risk of developing cardiovascular disease and ischemic stroke is found. Although it is clear that a healthy diet is a critical element of good cardiovascular health, the specific food choices to meet dietary requirements and healthful lifestyles are not fully understood. In this paper we provide a general overview of the most widely consumed seafood foods, discuss their nutritional content, and describe their nutritional effects. A large number of epidemiological and laboratory studies have found positive associations between the intake of seafood and the risk of cardiovascular disease. For example, fish intake is positively associated with risk of incident coronary heart disease and stroke (CVD), and low-fat diets rich in fish may have an even greater protective effect on cardiovascular health than the consumption of fish in a variety of other dietary contexts. Dietary habits should therefore be altered to include higher intakes of fish.

One thing that's important is to get a good fit and get rid of all the unwanted details. We can get away with this because of the nature of the skin texture. It's a lot easier to create a skin texture with lots of detail on top than to get rid of it!

In order to make sure it's all in good shape we can do one of two things:

"BART and San Francisco Police Department are working together to increase transparency in the BART system and will soon make all police-recorded information public on the agency's website, the two agencies announced this week.

""We believe this will increase accountability for both officers and riders, and ensure transparency of what is going on,"" BART police Capt. Ignacio De La Rosa said at the Bay Area Council meeting on Wednesday.

The website is set to go live this month. It will provide access to information such as how often and for how long an officer makes a call on each incident, whether that officer makes an arrest or not and whether a police report is issued.

The department's new website, www.bart.gov, is designed to make it easy for the public to find police records online. The department already had a website where people could search for and see all officers' personnel records, but De La Rosa said that the new website would provide more detail about what kind of records were available, when they are available and what information was available on them.

BART is working on other improvements, including a pilot program in the San Francisco and Alameda Counties to make officers available to work at neighborhood precincts during shifts and a program to make all"
"The news was released just over two months after a team of doctors recommended against surgery in May 2014, and two years after the first diagnosis. The patient is not the first to seek such a treatment. A patient who has lived in the United States for two decades had to have surgery for a tumor on the left side of her brain in February 2013. And last year, an unnamed patient who has lived in the U.S. since the 1990s sought a ""muti-therapy"" to shrink the tumor that she was diagnosed with.

The doctors said they would recommend the operation in that case. ""She had an extremely large tumor, it had a high probability of being cancerous, and she wanted it removed,"" the surgeon said. ""The surgery was very difficult, but in my opinion the right decision for her.""

A doctor who worked at the same hospital as Dr. Weiss, who did not want his name used, told NBC News that he had heard of cases of patients in which the surgery is not performed and the tumors continue to grow.

In an email, the hospital said the patient has ""been fully examined by neurologists who determined there is no cancer, no neurological signs of anything,"" and ""there is no risk for"
"The president has taken a very unusual step: He is calling the media out by name, in the very news organizations whose coverage he's been criticized for in the past.

On Tuesday evening, Obama called on journalists to hold themselves to a higher standard than his administration, specifically criticizing ""some of the folks on cable news"" for not being fair to him.

""I don't expect to get everything exactly right,"" the president told The Associated Press. ""And I know that some of the folks in the press corps will be frustrated. They're probably a little frustrated because, frankly, we haven't always been as open as we could be.""

The president has been particularly critical of cable news reporters, particularly those with conservative views. On Friday, for instance, Obama blasted Fox News Channel's Eric Bolling, calling the conservative pundit a ""right-wing conspiracy theorist,"" while noting that he doesn't have to like the results of a Fox poll.

In a Wednesday morning tweet, the president said that he had been ""unfair to [Fox News anchor] Chris Wallace,"" a claim he also made in the past, even when Wallace himself called it false.

The statement also noted the university has recently reaffirmed its commitment to the free exercise of religious freedom and the free expression of ideas.

In addition, the statement noted that the school will continue to respect the rights of those students to hold, and the university will respect their freedom to speak out.

In response to the recent statement, the ACLU of Kentucky, a state-level group that promotes the free speech of its members and provides legal help in civil liberties cases, has written to the president and chancellor of the University of Louisville and asked them to provide assurances to all students in the school's student organization, the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. The letter reads:

""While the ACLU believes the university's response is reasonable and consistent with the law, it would like to reaffirm its commitment to free expression.

"Rising from the ashes of the U.S. auto industry, General Motors' Cadillac division was an instant success in its first two decades of existence. But now the car maker has suffered another loss.

A source close to GM's management tells CBS News the company plans to lay off 4,500 employees in its U.S. plant, in a move expected to start as soon as this summer.

""Cadillac's in a difficult place. We don't think that this will have any impact on Cadillac's performance,"" GM spokesman Tom Wickham said.

Basic Gameplay

Tower Defence

Tower Defence is your main defence. If you have to escape or attack your opponent, this will make the battle much easier for you. The basic way to tower block is by having two minions that attack your opponent's minion, the opponent then has to move his minions out of range, to avoid having a minion take damage from the enemy tower.

There is a method in this, using minions, but you can also just place your hero behind your minions to make your life easier, as it allows your minions to move back to your hero if the tower takes too long to destroy your minion. This can be useful if your opponent has a large hero such as Axe or Warlock.

President Barack Obama is seeking $1.5 billion more to speed the processing of refugee applications in 2017. And the Department of Health and Human Services wants to boost the number of people admitted from abroad.

"The University of Kentucky's Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter was disbanded Friday morning following an investigation that found a student who died on a fraternity pledge trip had been drugged with an illegal drug, the school confirmed.

""The chapter at this point has been disbanded, and the university is investigating all the facts that they have in connection to this case,"" Kentucky spokeswoman Alison Powers said Friday.

Powers would not provide any additional details, other than to confirm the drug in question is ""date rape"" and that the investigation is ongoing.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon President Rick Warren released the following statement late Friday evening:

""It has come to our attention that a chapter member, in the interest of fraternity brotherhood and brotherhood for others, had participated in a date-rape-like situation at a residence hall on September 5th. As the investigation continues, it is my understanding that there may be other possible instances where this is possible. We must have the strongest possible procedures and procedures for every case of this nature to ensure our safety. At the present time, no one from the chapter has been disciplined and we have been assured by the university that it has no intention of pursuing disciplinary action against the chapter.""

"As of Thursday night, the federal government was spending more than $200,000 every day it had in cash — in excess of $200,000 per day since March 9th, which is the first day of the government's first shutdown.

It was unclear Thursday morning whether that total would rise, as some people and groups who oppose the shutdown continued to demand a resolution. The total, which includes funds earmarked to keep the government running and money spent by other government departments and agencies, amounts to roughly $534.5 million.

That's enough to run a city the size of San Antonio for three and a half weeks — more than five days.

It's been an emotional journey. It was an exciting and exhausting time for everyone involved. It was an intense creative experience that required us to do some serious thinking.

"In a landmark decision on Wednesday, the Supreme Court struck down a federal law that effectively prevented the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases and other ""greenhouse gases,"" known as GHGs. The court held that the EPA must now regulate GHGs under the Clean Air Act. The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by 26 states, industry and a number of individuals who believe that the Clean Air Act, which has been on the books for more than 40 years, needs to be amended.

In their ruling, the justices also rejected a lower court's interpretation of the law and the EPA's ability to regulate GHGs, writing, ""the agency lacks authority under section 111 to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, including the GHGs of a given source, unless the source is emitting the greenhouse gas at the time the rule is promulgated."" The EPA is the federal government's chief regulatory agency and has been given a mandate to regulate GHGs.

The ruling came as a surprise, coming less than three years after a U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the Clean Air Act, as originally written, ""does not give EPA the authority to regulate GHG emissions"" and that ""Congress never intended for GHG regulation to be a core function of EPA.""

"Rarity: R Card Type: Enchantment Creature — Sphinx P/T: 4 / 3 Expansion: Amonkhet Rarity: Uncommon All Sets: Card Number: 55 Artist: Mathias Kollros Rulings An ability that triggers whenever an artifact becomes tapped can trigger whenever a Sphinx is tapped for any reason. The ability checks whether the artifact has been untapped recently, not whether it was already untapped. If an effect tries to put the Sphinx into a graveyard or to put it onto the battlefield attacking, and that effect tries to resolve before the Sphinx is on the battlefield, that effect won't resolve because it has no legal targets. You won't exile it."
"In the wake of a stunning report about how the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation had colluded to target political enemies and make it look like a crime, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was interviewed on CBS This Morning.

As noted by The Washington Examiner's Byron York, Clapper, a former Republican Senator who was President Barack Obama's first director of national intelligence, defended his decision to allow his employees to read intelligence reports before the Senate Intelligence Committee, and said the public shouldn't ""throw up our hands"" in horror over the revelations about how the FBI and Justice Department were acting with the knowledge and approval of President Barack Obama and his White House.

""There are those that want to see some accountability in Washington and there are those who say, well, I think it's an appropriate thing,"" said Clapper, who served in the Senate from 1975-74 and is a former Navy Seal. ""We will see what happens in the weeks to come, but I don't see the need to throw up our hands in despair, which would be unfortunate, but also would not be appropriate. It's just important for people to know the truth.""

The CBS interviewer noted that Clapper has admitted that he didn't ""recall"
"""I don't think it's possible to take away from what was a wonderful and unique performance from our guys in terms of how they came out in the first half,"" head coach Mike Zimmer said after the Vikings' 22-0 victory over the Jaguars. ""We did some really good things offensively, we had some great rushes on offense. We got a couple big sacks, so I was happy with that. Defensively, we did a pretty good job in the second half and it's tough to take away from what happened.

""The way our team came together after the first half and kind of made adjustments on defense in the second half was great to see.""

The Vikings, who are on a six-game losing streak, finally broke the deadlock early in the fourth quarter when they forced a three-and-out from the Jaguars with the help of a long field goal and a penalty on the Jaguars' own penalty unit. They then put the game out of reach in the closing seconds by putting together three straight sacks that gave them an insurmountable 17-0 lead.

It's a lot easier to get the offense back to playing well after the first quarter when your defense has to step up, right?

Well, the"
"The World Series of Fighting has a lot riding on it this weekend, as the promotion returns to Las Vegas, and in a huge way.

The UFC is expected to hold their second ever show on pay-per-view at T-Mobile Arena. UFC officials will host the press conference to officially announce the new promotion on Sunday. The press conference is also expected to feature UFC light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier, who was the UFC's heavyweight champion before the company relaunched in 2013, and heavyweight champ Stipe Miocic, who defeated Roy Nelson on Sept. 9 in a title defense.

""We're just getting ready to put on the show,"" said WSOF president Ray Sefo, who said that he believes that the WSOF will be in the running to host a second pay-per-view show on UFC Fight Pass in 2016.

WSOF returns to the Mandalay Bay Events Center on Saturday for an evening of fights.

WSOF 11 features a bantamweight title bout between champ Marlon Moraes (21-6-1 MMA, 3-1 WSOF) and Cody McKenzie (23-10-1 MMA, 9-7 WSOF). Also featured is"

"""A couple of weeks ago I had an incident. A girl, a friend of mine, who is a good friend of mine, came and talked to me in a very unkind manner,"" the actress, who is engaged to Tom Hanks, tells Variety about a ""bizarre incident."" ""I'm just really glad she was there because that's not a way to treat a woman, especially someone of my age. But she was really rude. I mean really rude.""

""And that was really bad, to be honest with you. Because that was something that was completely inappropriate.""

In a statement to The Sunday Times, the group of 100 bankers, economists and businessmen, from some of Europe's leading firms, said their conversation ""was an interesting conversation between people from different walks of life.

"Bolivia, like much of the rest of the world, has had a tough week, and its economy is being dragged down by the worst inflation in a generation.

But in one part of Bolivia's central region, it looks like the world has just had another boom, with a local development organization touting an increase of $50,000 to its budget in the space of one year.

""It is amazing how the government's efforts are working. This is a great example,"" said Dario Lopez, head of the Bolivian Association for the Advancement of Women, or ABWE, which works in the Santa Cruz and Cauca areas in the center of the country. ""There is more money. We're more prosperous now, with better salaries.""

The new development model that the Bolivian government is putting in place, which it hopes to be adopted across the nation, has the support of a coalition of NGOs, the U.S.-based Center for Global Development and the U.N. Development Programme.

In an attempt to give Bolivia an economic edge against neighboring Brazil and Peru, which are both seen as much more developed, the government has begun implementing a program in which it spends less on public works, which"
"If you've got the time and money to indulge your sweet tooth, then why not buy a set of gummy bear flavored lip balms? These treats are filled with a blend of cocoa and sugar. If you don't want to indulge yourself with these gummy bears, there is always the chocolate flavored version that tastes just like chocolate gummies.

Here is how you can make a gummy bear lip balm:

1. Pour your choice of dark or light colored lip balm in a container.

2. Place the mixture on the lip balm, gently rub your lips over it, then wait until your lips have hardened.

3. Dip a cotton swab or cotton swab applicator into your gummy bear flavored lip balm.

4. Use the applicator to gently rub your lips, and you'll have your perfect gummy bear flavor!

Tip: When making this lip balm recipe, remember that you can add the chocolate flavor to the lip balm to make a more complex flavor. You can even use chocolate flavoring to make your chocolate flavored lip balm a little sweeter and a little less chocolate-like.

Enjoy your delicious gummy bear flavor!

"We've known about this since it was announced, but a few months back I posted some screenshots showing the progress. In that post, I wrote that they were going to be released in early January, but now they have a new date and more information on them!

First of all, you'll notice the fact that it is now in English. You may also notice the fact that they are using a lot of ""KanColle"" in their release date announcement. This is because, at this moment, they're releasing it on the 30th of this month, and will continue until March 3rd of 2017. They're hoping that it will be ""one of the biggest and most exciting titles"" to hit the Wii U so far.

As I've stated before, they're looking to have it ""one of the biggest and most exciting titles"" to hit the Wii U so far. I'll talk about the release date when I have something concrete, but until then I will let you all know that it's going to be one of the biggest titles they have in development for the system.

"The 2016 US presidential race was full of drama. A slew of polls showed Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump.

But it turned out that a significant percentage of Clinton supporters believed that she should be imprisoned and the FBI's decision not to recommend prosecuting her was met with boos and chants of ""Lock her up!"" from a largely Democratic audience at the third presidential debate.

The Democratic National Committee and Clinton supporters, of course, would have us believe that it was a fair contest and the outcome was a foregone conclusion.

But the 2016 US presidential campaign is an important lesson for Canadians who might want to try their hand at political campaigning and a warning about the risks of using public polling data to inform the electoral process.

In an effort to determine who should be president, voters were polled on several questions, such as who would better deal with ISIS. The question of whether to go to war was also put to the people.

A total of 5,500 voters in all 50 states were interviewed and each question was answered with a single percentage point, giving us the most precise way of estimating support.

A total of 4.5 per cent of voters said the candidate who has the better chance of winning the White House would go to war"

"""You'll get better and better with this,"" she said.

"The state-of-the-art laboratory for the development of pharmaceuticals in the US will soon be located in the southern Israeli town of Tifereth.

The facility is the result of the Israel Association of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IAAPMA) and the National Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Foundation. The new institute, to be called the Institute for Drug and Medicinal Products (IDAP), will be the world's largest pharmaceutical laboratory in terms of the number of researchers, the size of its laboratories and its infrastructure, including a medical research facility, according to an announcement on Monday by IAPMA CEO Arie Zabel.

According to Zabel, IDAPMA, a partnership between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies, was founded to enable research in Israel, with the objective of bringing about technological and scientific progress.

"Rearranging the ""a"" and the ""i"" on the name of the state, I like what it would be called: The ""American Samoa."" It would be a good fit with our name, ""the Land of the Free,"" which we believe is a metaphor for a nation that was born free. We would then be the most free of the Free People in the World.

There's something else that would make me proud of the name. I believe it would be the name for the American Samoa that President George W. Bush, then in his last days as President of the United States, gave his adopted brother Jeb. Jeb's father, the late Prescott Bush, was a Bush from America Samoa, a place I've long believed was part of our own American Samoa.

There are no U.S. passports, no visas for travel between our two countries. We share only our currency, our common history and the American Samoa government. We are American Samoans, but not American Samoa.

President Bush, when he made his brother a United States Senator, was a part-American Samoa resident. When Bush, when he became the Vice-President in 1999, was in a position to appoint an Ambassador-at-Large,"

"The Los Angeles City Council approved an agreement with Google that will give the internet search giant access to and control over nearly every piece of property in Los Angeles for the next 40 years.

The council on Friday voted 4-3 to give the internet company exclusive rights to the area from Wilshire Boulevard to the Santa Monica Pier. The council will make an announcement next month.

The city and the company are working out details on the terms of the agreement and whether any environmental review or community involvement is needed, but a representative from the company told The Huffington Post on Friday that Google had committed to being transparent in how it would use the area.

Google had initially been seeking approval for the area for the past decade, but the city denied its requests and it had been seeking approval from the state as well.

City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement Friday that ""The council voted on a measure to bring the internet company in for 40 years."" He added:

The internet company will have access to every single building, street and property within the area and the council's approval is the first step toward ensuring that they operate with respect for our community, the environment and other businesses and residents in the area. We look forward to a collaborative partnership with"
"""I was not surprised. I would be the same. The fact that there are people that think I am the devil is disgusting,"" Trump said on Fox & Friends this morning, after a segment in which a woman described a conversation with him where he talked about his sexual exploits with her.

""You know what, it doesn't matter what [the woman] says, what the circumstances are,"" he said, referring to the audio, ""What matters is that these are vicious false attacks.""

""And frankly I'll take a lot of heat because I'm pretty good at this,"" Trump continued.

Trump is now trying to reframe his response to the recording to avoid being pinned down on it, calling the recording ""nothing"" when pressed to elaborate, saying instead, ""it's a lot of noise"" when pressed further about whether he ever sexually assaults women.

He also defended himself in the Fox News interview, saying ""there's never been a tape."""
"If you are a person with an active sex life, or who likes to experiment with sex toys and the like, there's a good chance that you will want to have a lot of toys and other items with your new vibrator. If you are looking for the best quality, best quality vibrators in the world, then we're going to introduce you to a company called Lovehoney, that will definitely please you! They will make you love vibrators as much as we love vibrators.

What is the best way to decide if your sex toy will fit into your budget? You could pick up a sex toy for cheap, or buy it used and try it out, but why not combine both ways? Let's talk about how you can decide if the price is worth the quality you can get from the manufacturer of the vibrator you buy!

Best quality

First things first. When buying sex toys, it is important to consider what kind of sex toys are in demand, what the best sex toy makers in the world are making, and what kinds of quality are available at your local stores. When shopping around for the best vibrators and sex toys, it's important to understand what kind of vibrators are the best quality for you,"
"AUSTRALIAN rugby star Jason Taumalolo will undergo surgery on Tuesday to repair the medial ligament in his left knee, with a return date still to be decided.

Taumalolo has suffered the injury during the round 15 State of Origin clash between New South Wales and Queensland at ANZ Stadium on Sunday.

He was helped from the field immediately and taken straight to hospital to have the damage assessed, before undergoing the surgery.

It's understood the 29-year-old will have to spend six-to-eight weeks out of the game.

Taumalolo is considered to be one of the most feared backmen in the NRL with his power running and ability to win his own ball.

He had played his last game of NRL at the start of this season and his club has made it clear they have no desire to see him leave the field this year."
"In an interview on Tuesday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said that she has not made up her mind about a Senate Judiciary subcommittee hearing scheduled to start Wednesday on a proposed law to stop ""rogue"" gun dealers from making unlicensed sales of weapons.

The proposed legislation would make it illegal for people to ""knowingly make, obtain or sell"" a weapon ""for use"" in the commission of a crime or ""to aid or abet, counsel or procure any person to commit a crime of violence."" The law would also ban sales by so-called straw purchases, or purchases at gun shows or through a third-party.

Feinstein has expressed deep reservations about the proposal. The California senator told MSNBC last month that ""if there was ever a law to prevent a bad guy with a gun from getting a gun, that would be a very bad law.""

She told Fox News on Tuesday, however, that ""the idea of the straw purchasing law has a lot of merit to it"" and that the subcommittee ""may well want to hear from all the experts in that regard, both of law enforcement, mental health and mental health care.""

It was only a few days after I moved back to London after spending two years living in Tokyo and, for me, a strange feeling began to emerge: I wasn't living in the city anymore. In Tokyo I felt I could do anything; I had freedom; I could travel wherever I wanted to go; I had friends in my hometown of London and people in Japan I was meeting for the first time. But I didn't feel that freedom in London, or even in the West Country, which felt a lot more ""local"" than the city itself.

London feels different than any city I've lived in. I have always been an expat; my entire adult life, I've been living and travelling outside of my homeland of Ireland, and London, though it was not a destination for me before, feels like it should be. The city's lack of culture or identity made me feel a lot less connected to the city itself; the constant change and changes in weather, people and restaurants felt alien, even when I had never lived outside of Europe before. I've been to Paris, Berlin and Madrid before and, even with all of these places being within easy travel distance from London, London felt completely"
"""If the public does not get its act together in a big way in this election cycle, we are in trouble. It's already becoming evident that our presidential elections are being run like a casino."" — Bill Kristol

There are a lot of problems with our politics in America, but it seems that one of them has gone virtually unnoticed for the last 30 years or so: the increasing role of money in our political process. In the 1990's, the political parties were controlled by a relatively small number of rich men, who had no interest in publicizing or explaining how much money they spent on the campaigns, but were quite happy to raise it. As the 2000 elections made clear, however, this situation could not go on forever, and by 2012 the two parties were both spending huge sums of money to ensure their survival. This was especially the case in presidential elections, which, due to the importance of fundraising and television advertising, had become the primary way to determine the winner of a presidential campaign. In 2008, both the Republicans and the Democrats raised record amounts of money, and in 2012, the parties each spent a staggering amount of money in their races. The 2012 elections have, however, revealed some troubling trends that may signal that we have entered an era where"

And that is just a fraction of what will happen when we fail to act.

There are three key ways climate change will damage us, and I want you to understand what the threats are and how they are related.

As of 2015, the world has over 30 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that we can emit. That is 30 billion tonnes.

The most recent data I have, shows that the world emitted a whopping 0.9 gigatonnes of CO 2 equivalent last year. This is less than 1% of our total greenhouse gas emissions, which is the same as the population of the UK.

By 2060 we're on track to emit 6 gigatonnes. So what can be done? We need to start now. We need"

"""It was an accident. I wasn't doing anything. It's over.""

The last time I heard this phrase was on a documentary about a high school quarterback. He'd just thrown an interception to an Arizona Cardinals safety and had his coach explain to me why the game was over. It was an unfortunate but honest explanation for how it had played out, and I was struck by the sentiment, because the phrase resonates with me in this moment, where my daughter is at the mercy of her teacher, a stranger to her and the rest of us.

My daughter is only 7, but I think I already know her future. She'll play the role of a coach on the playground. She'll play the part of the principal of the middle school where she's a senior. She'll be a parent on a family trip to Disneyland or a movie in a family theatre, where her teacher will be an actual human being with real opinions on things, not just the robot in the white coat who answers ""I'm sorry, ma'am."" She'll play the role of a child who is able to step in for a teacher in the midst of an emergency when their school closes or when their bus doesn't show up, or when the teacher can't"
"Bees have an important job to do—they pollinate our food, clean our environment, and create beauty all in their tiny little bodies.

And for the most part, they are pretty great at it. They've been pollinating plants for a long, long time, and the best-known example of a bee pollination is of course the apple, which is actually the result of hundreds of generations of pollinating by bees.

But not every plant can be pollinated. Sometimes the plants that need to be pollinated are just so special, like those plants that produce flowers only on a few days out of the year or flowers that bloom at specific times of the year, like tulips. These special flowers are pollinated by different species of bees, and we'll learn about that in just a second.

But there are also plants that can be pollinated only by a certain kind of bee, called ""special bees."" And they are pollinating these special flowers by doing what's known as ""sap feeding,"" which involves sticking their mouthparts into the flowers.

To explain more about that, let's start by looking at a simple example of how a flower can be pollinated. Let's say there's a plant with"
"""We will never, ever be able to put that on a billboard or post on Facebook. I can assure you that,"" said Tom Seltzer, spokesman for the New York-based group that owns the billboard, which reads, ""The world will never be the same"" with the word ""CHANGE"" below.

Seltzer said the sign is a reference to a letter to President Donald Trump written by more than 100 professors from the country's top colleges, colleges of arts and sciences. They say they are withdrawing their offers of admission to Trump University in light of the president's attacks on immigrants and women's health, among other things.

Trump, in turn, has responded to the professors with tweets.

Seltzer said that the group decided to go public after hearing Trump's comments to ABC News that the professors had not received a ""free speech"" exemption to protest.

""The fact is that this president has an unbridled license to say whatever he wants without having to take the time to do his homework,"" said Seltzer.

Seltzer said he has contacted the New York Attorney General's Office, who could make an example out of Trump University and potentially have to pay $1.5 million"

"Betsy DeVos has been tapped for secretary of Education by President Trump. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)

President Trump is nominating Betsy DeVos to serve as secretary of education, and here are four ways she could reshape public education:

1. Create an enormous amount of new money to support school choice

The secretary's biggest challenge may be convincing the Trump administration that a federal mandate to educate every child, regardless of their ZIP code, is a bad idea. That means pushing back hard on the Common Core State Standards. DeVos and Education Secretary John B. King Jr. both want the Obama-era law repealed. The new secretary will need to ensure that Trump doesn't squelch states that embrace Common Core or the ""college-for-all"" initiative pushed by a few governors, like Ohio Gov. John Kasich.

[The education secretary picks for Trump and DeVos]

The new secretary would need to create millions of dollars a year in new funds to expand charter and vouchers programs. DeVos has made education a cornerstone of her own philanthropic career.

2. Take the federal role in school discipline and teacher evaluation to new levels

The U.S. Department of Education, led by DeVos, is already"
"As I'm sure most of you already know, I have been trying to figure out why people like me don't have enough time for playing the game, so that we can all make some real progress on improving. It seems to me that this is a big problem, and I thought I would put it on the front page to try and get the attention of Blizzard, but they probably aren't listening, because they seem to have already forgotten what made StarCraft such a great game and just decided to make it the best game it possibly could be. So here I am, trying to find some answers and writing up what I can think of so far, so hopefully this helps people get to some places they can use as inspiration, instead of just saying, ""Blizzard sucks. StarCraft is stupid. We all suck. Go play Starcraft.""

So far the answers I have received have all been: ""it's complicated,"" ""you're probably just an asshole,"" ""there are a million things to do,"" or ""just keep playing."" The latter two seem pretty true.

Here is the list of things that I have thought up.

"The city of Baltimore and state police on Friday released new dashcam video from a police chase last summer that resulted in the fatal shooting of an unarmed suspect, but not the full footage.

State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby and City Solicitor George Nilson, who reviewed the video, released a statement saying they will release a full video, with sound, by early next week.

The dashcam video released Friday does not include footage that showed the vehicle's final seconds or the fatal gunshot to the back of 25-year-old Freddie Gray.

The Baltimore Police Department on Thursday said it was ""continually reviewing"" the dashcam footage in hopes of finding out what happened after a police van mounted a median, struck a curb, and dragged Gray to the sidewalk, where he died a week later.

""We believe it will help answer a question we have all asked — how could this happen?"" said State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, whose office is handling the case. ""I can only imagine the anguish the community must have had.""

State police released the new dashcam footage of Gray's death last summer after it said they had no legal basis for withholding the video. The release of the video was part of an"
"It was a surprise, really: A week after the news broke of the resignation of his predecessor as Toronto Police Services Board chairman, Paul La Forge, Rob Ford took to Twitter and accused the chair of making him a scapegoat for a police board he's not even on.

Ford's outburst came as the Toronto Star reported that La Forge has stepped down from his position at the end of June. Ford, the embattled mayor of Toronto, accused the police board chairman of making the news a ""distraction.""

Ford tweeted that he and the police board chair had ""had our differences but he was an asset to my campaign. I thank him for all his service. We're in the middle of a rebuilding job, let's keep things positive.""

It wasn't a shock: The police board has been under siege this week, as Ford, a longtime member, stepped down from his seat at the top of the police board, and a second chair, Chris Bolton, announced he would not run for re-election in April.

The turmoil is a consequence of Ford's handling of a controversial police investigation into whether the mayor and his friends were involved in criminal activity, and an ensuing coverup of those activities, including"
"It's not uncommon for us to talk about our favorite video games.

In fact, the amount of time and energy that goes into writing about and discussing a single video game can be pretty impressive, which makes the fact that so much of our attention and passion is focused on Destiny all the more remarkable.

Since it launched earlier this year, Destiny has become one of the most anticipated titles of 2016. That's a bit surprising when you think about the amount of hype, support and excitement surrounding this new title. It's not just the fact that people have been dying to get their hands on a copy, either. Destiny was one of the most talked-about titles of E3 2015, with Destiny 2 not far behind in second. It has become such a hit that there has been speculation as to what the series is going to do in the future, with some wondering whether Destiny could even continue in a post-Destiny world.

At E3 2015, Bungie said that it would be ""crazy"" if Destiny didn't return for another go, so the fact that Bungie is considering Destiny's future in a post-Destiny world is exciting for the fans who are eagerly anticipating its next outing. However, that's not all that Bungie is planning"

Mr. Perez's comment — which echoed those made by many in the progressive movement, as well as some Democrats — came a day before Mrs. Clinton delivered an acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. It is a stark contrast from the two parties' respective conventions a few months ago. In Cleveland, Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton seemed to have reached an understanding to build on a Democratic unity that many saw as lacking after the bruising 2016 primary between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton.

Now, Mr. Sanders's campaign appears to have fizzled and the former secretary of state appears poised to win her party's presidential nomination, with an impressive margin over Mr. Trump, a real"

So said Mark J. DeFrancesco, the interim superintendent of schools, last month of the high school student population he has been tasked to manage in a state in which more than half the students are functionally illiterate.

It was not just that he was addressing students who have been suspended more often than in years past. He was addressing them from an audience of adults who, according to a survey by the American Council of Trustees and Alumni, have ""no confidence in the educational system as currently administered,"" a sentiment that the school system itself seems to be struggling with.

For years, New Jersey's public schools have been in an on-again, off-again crisis. There is little question that the crisis was exacerbated in the 1990s and the first few years of this century, as state legislators began cutting education budgets. But that has only exacerbated the crisis in the last 15 years, and has contributed to a"

She sighed, looking at the ground. She hadn't even left the apartment yet, but the conversation she'd just had seemed to last for hours. It seemed that this girl, despite having been born to wealth and privilege, had a soul like a fish that was slowly rotting away.

The voice, who seemed to have gotten off at that moment, turned and started walking in the direction of the city center.

"""The power to suspend the operation of the constitutional order in a given country and to declare a state of emergency.""

Those words were the most striking part of President Obama's speech Tuesday at the National Defense University in Washington, D.C., the same day that his Justice Department released a declassified version of the National Security Letter statute he cited in justifying a massive and ongoing surveillance operation on millions of U.S. citizens.

That power, known as ""the power to suspend the operation of the constitutional order in a given country,"" has long been recognized in the law by federal judges, but never before in such detail and in the language used in a speech at an influential U.S. military school.

It is the very essence of presidential power, the ability to rule by decree with the power of a dictator, or even by an act of Congress. And in a nation founded on the rule of law, the power to suspend the rule of law is an outrage, not an exaggeration.

As a presidential candidate in 2008, Barack Obama claimed he could ""whip"" the government into action to protect American citizens. As president, he has used it, with some degree of success, to circumvent the constitutional limits on executive power and the"

"BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) — Colombia's government announced Wednesday a major overhaul of its agricultural system, seeking to shift to more organic, locally produced food in an attempt to cut the nation's huge public debt.

The new regulations, which come into force this week, call for the national food chain to become more transparent, allow the sale of smaller quantities of certain crops, and ban the sale of food produced on large industrial farms, according to Agriculture Secretary David Garcia.

""We must have an agricultural system that produces high-quality products and respects our environment, while promoting sustainable practices and local producers,"" Garcia said at the unveiling of the regulations, which were issued by the country's Agriculture Secretariat and signed by President Juan Manuel Santos.

The new regulations would give farmers access to financing that they currently are not able to access because of the current legal system that makes it hard for small-scale farmers to access loans and markets for their produce, Garcia said.

""This is the only way that the country will be able to start rebuilding the public budget,"" Garcia said. ""If the agricultural system continues on its present trajectory, there will be more than 20 percent of the population without a job and with a chronic disease in 10 years."""
"This post has been updated to clarify the changes to the company's annual shareholder letter.

Last month, Google announced its biggest change since the launch of Google.com.

It had no other news.

In fact, Google made no announcements at all for its second quarter of 2015, which ended March 31.

And while we could point to the absence of a financial update, that didn't explain why Google would release only an executive summary, which didn't disclose much, or a companywide presentation that was just a bit of an eye-roll.

Today, however, the search giant provided some clarity on the future of Google, in a companywide investor letter (pdf) published by Google's financial blog, Googly.

Mr Abbott unveiled a plan for an overhaul of the government's welfare payments last month and announced last month the new $8 billion Australian Communications and Media Authority, to oversee a number of the government's proposed changes to the welfare system, would begin work by mid-May.

But the new mobile phone subsidy is just one of many proposed measures announced last week by Mr Abbott as part of the government's long-awaited budget, which is being presented in parliament tomorrow.

In his speech in Adelaide on Tuesday night, Mr Abbott will unveil plans to remove the ""stop-go"" nature of welfare payments by reducing the maximum length of time a person is eligible to receive a benefit and will increase the amount people receive over a 12 month period.

Under the Coalition's proposal, families would have access to the new mobile phone subsidy at the point of need, but not immediately after it was introduced, the government said.

It passed the Senate with a 68-31 vote this past Monday and was passed in the House last week by a vote of 414 to 1, which was supported by the NSA, who spent over $10 million on the campaign.

As The Washington Post points out, it was a big victory for the NSA, who said that they needed to keep up their efforts against terrorist activity.

In addition to bulk data collection, the law gives the government broad legal immunity for spying on Americans' international phone calls, as long as they don't know who the call is with, or that they're listening to it. The Post explains:

There is the installation disk, a repair disk, the Apple disk utility (or the OS X installer), and an upgrade partition table that will allow you to upgrade from an earlier version of the OS X to an even more recent one. This partition table is needed because Apple's own operating systems (OS X and iOS) can only install to certain partitions on an Apple computer, so when an OS X upgrade is attempted, it can fail.

"The next time someone asks me for the most powerful car you ever bought, I can just point to one. It was my second-generation Ford Escort S-Line. The original, sold in 1987, had been the car I grew up with, the one my brother and I had used for many a road trip, the car we took to summer camp when I was eight years old, the car we took to every college game, the one my brother and I bought the day before he passed away from cancer.

That Escort S-Line had an automatic transmission and a 4-speed automatic transmission, and I'll always think about those cars when I look back at my career, which spanned nearly a dozen decades, from my childhood in the Midwest to the pinnacle of my career, with the Detroit Red Wings, when I won two Stanley Cups, and more.

In fact, that car, that first generation of Escorts, is one of the cars I've used most in the NHL. And the most memorable moment of that first run was not the game or the moment or the goals or even the fact that I won a Cup. It was when I first put my hand in the door of that car after scoring my first playoff goal."

A number of the best punk and emo bands were based out of Liverpool, and it was one of those bands, the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, that turned me on to a new band that had me in stitches, the Pop Group. In their prime, this is the best band ever.

The Mighty Mighty Bosstones were formed by Steve Hackett in 1968 and went on to sell over five million albums, and in recent years, they've toured the world and played to massive audiences. But as much as we'd love to think of them as the biggest band in the world, the truth is they were actually more of a pop act. And when the Pop Group emerged, their style of singing and music were a complete break from what anyone had heard from them before. They had an energy, a youthful enthusiasm that made it a real treat to see them play live.

Their debut single, 'Wipe Out,' is a real stunner. They sing of 'a place we're all going to' and how 'they've got a chance to change it' with an irresistible hook that made me think, ""Whoa! I haven't heard a band so sure of their place and their power!"""

"As of last Friday, the second of a two-part series, my book ""A Life In Ruins"" (which you can pre-order at amazon.com and amazon.co.jp ) is on the top spot in Amazon's Bestsellers section in Japan and has a rating of 4.9. The second part will be posted tomorrow, but here's the first: ""How to Survive Japan's Next Big Disaster"". It has been a pleasure writing the book and I've enjoyed meeting a number of wonderful readers and talking to them about the book and what I have written. It was also a great privilege to meet Mr. Atsushi Aida and his wife, Dr. Masako. I can't tell you how grateful I am that I was allowed to join the conversation about Japan's future as I write about it. The book has a very clear message.

A few words on the subject are in order. I'll be honest and say I had my doubts as I was writing. The economy was weak, there were lots of problems with Japan's nuclear program and a few of my ideas were pretty far-fetched. However, after finishing the first draft of the book and going through several rounds of edits, it became clear that"
"In the spring of 1740, a ship was attacked by a Dutch fleet in the North Sea, leaving only three men on board, all of them officers. The two survivors, who were wounded, managed to reach a nearby ship in which they were picked up and taken to the city of Copenhagen. When they arrived they were quickly recognized and made a very poor impression upon the Danish population. The survivors were taken back to their ship and the next morning a man, known as 'Lionel the Seaman,' was ordered to carry a message to the Netherlands. Lionel, as he was called, did as he was ordered. But, when the captain was asked who had delivered the message he replied: ""I.""

It was the start of an adventure which would see Lionel and the two others become heroes to the Danes and eventually, to the British people. The story of their capture by the Dutch is the inspiration for a novel, 'The Nightingale of Olden Time'.

In this episode, we look at what happened on that fateful night, as well as how it helped the British Empire expand into what was to be their largest overseas empire in the 18th century."
"Brett Rypien will play Sunday. The Buffalo Bills' backup quarterback has a sprained AC joint in his throwing shoulder, and has missed the last four games. Rypien has completed 9-of-11 passes for 113 yards, no touchdowns, one interception and a 96.5 rating. He also rushed for 37 yards and a score.

Rypien had an MRI on the shoulder Monday morning that showed the damage was worse than previously thought, a source with knowledge of the situation told ESPN NFL Insider Adam Schefter. Rypien had surgery earlier this month and was expected to be out a couple of weeks.

""We were all anticipating Brett not being out,"" coach Chan Gailey said, via The Buffalo News. ""The last week has been a learning process. Brett was coming in this week. He wasn't quite as sharp as he wanted to be, but I thought he did a great job.""

The Bills have a bye in Week 11 and then have two weeks before playing at the Jets, so there's still time for the backup to heal and return for the Sept. 21 matchup with the New England Patriots. If not, he's a lock to miss a few games.

"In this paper, we develop and test the notion of ""network-centered cognitive dissonance,"" a construct that describes how individuals adjust their beliefs about an event when their network is disrupted by it. Network-centered cognitive dissonance has been theorized in several ways. Some scholars have described it as a type of cognitive dissonance (Dworak, 1992). Others have suggested that network-centered cognitive dissonance may be a consequence of cognitive dissonance itself, such as cognitive dissonance itself (Wang and Swann, 1999; D'Arcy et al., 2002; Lofstrom, 2009). Other scholars have described it as a way to characterize a specific psychological mechanism or construct that underlies network-based cognitive dissonance (Brickman and Todorov, 1993; Rutter et al., 2011; Blasco and DeCicco, 2012). Our purpose here is not to characterize a particular psychological mechanism but to use this theory as a tool for understanding network-based cognitive dissonance and as an empirical model for future research on it. We present several results in support of this conceptualization and test several key predictions. We argue that network-centered cognitive dissonance is not the same thing as cognitive dissonance, as a process by which"
In this paper we describe the construction and validation of an optical amplifier which generates a coherent light beam for the generation of an artificial microscope image. We present a detailed theoretical and computational analysis of the light-induced photonic amplification process for optical amplifiers in an optical system with a frequency response of λ∼100 GHz and a time delay of ∼2 ns. This approach yields the most efficient and coherent light beam for generating an artificial microscope image.

"""This is not the kind of thing we want to happen here. There is an expectation of what kind of community we are, and we should be better than that.""

— State Representative Dave Reed, the first African American to represent the state's 42nd district.

Last month, a man named Darren Goforth went to his local Target in Columbia to pick up a Christmas present for his girlfriend. Goforth, who is white, had never heard of a similar store in his neighborhood, and when he walked through the aisles of the store he found no one of color in sight. He said that as he stood there in the parking lot he ""could feel a chill down my spine,"" because the person behind him had noticed his unusual behavior, and a security guard told him to move back. Goforth was arrested.

Last week, Goforth pleaded guilty to a charge of unlawful surveillance of a person because of the color of their skin. He received a 30-day sentence.

In the past week, I have heard many people call Goforth a racist, an evil person, an ignorant person. These are people who think the color of someone's skin makes them a dangerous threat. People who believe that an innocent white guy walking"

One might be to live a healthier, more fulfilling life.

Another might be to be happy.

And the third might be to reach a place in life where our actions are the best they can possibly be.

We all have different ways of approaching life and how to get to those places.

So if we all had different goals and we were all doing our best, it's impossible that we'd all be happy.

We're all unique. We all have different motivations, goals, and perspectives on life.

When you have goals that aren't aligned with your goals, you're setting yourself up for failure and a lot of stress.

We need to work towards being happy with what we have and to get there.

The biggest reason for failure is not setting our goals.

The biggest reason for failure is not following our goals.

"In an article that is still being cited at the top of Google's search results for this very day, the Telegraph quotes a former government official claiming that the British intelligence service MI5 is still engaged in the illegal production and trafficking of drugs, even after its former director Sir Mark Allen was forced out in 2010.

Allen's downfall came about because of allegations that the British security services, as well as the NSA and CIA, were involved in the trafficking of illegal drugs. Allen, who led the UK's domestic security services for ten years, resigned in July 2010 after he was named as an undercover drug dealer who sold intelligence on behalf of MI5, and the security services' former intelligence liaison to MI6, Gareth Williams, was charged in 2013.

According to the Telegraph, ""A senior intelligence source told The Telegraph: ""The former head of MI5 is still involved in illegal drug production and trafficking.""

This is not the first time that British intelligence has been alleged to be involved in drugs. The Observer, for example, reported that in July, MI6 officers had met a Saudi banker to discuss ""a scheme to ship huge amounts of drugs, mainly cannabis, into the UK via the Caribbean,"" and that in May, police seized drugs on the"
"We all know the stories. In the wake of the ""Golden Age"" of TV in the 1990s and early 2000s, studios had the budgets, the power, and the vision to make hits on every level. They were all making high-profile series and movies about heroes who were better, stronger, more confident and better at what they did than any hero ever seen on screen. But a decade of steady ratings decline in the mid-to-late 2000s had all of these franchises starting to look tired. In addition, there was an even greater change underway, and the new shows and films were becoming increasingly expensive. As a result, many studios decided to put their bets elsewhere and went on hiatus. The Golden Age never ended. But a new wave of studio optimism has started. The first signs of change are already starting to appear in the television landscape. The CW and Amazon have both renewed their existing series. Disney has acquired some of the big-budget sci-fi properties of the last decade (Pacific Rim, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Doctor Who), while Netflix and HBO have picked up shows that could be huge hits. The latest round of these bets may not have any obvious predecessors (for instance, a series based on Marvel Comics), but it will"
"It's a strange time to be a journalist. Journalists are now so ubiquitous as to be the subject of endless self-conscious, even ironic commentary on their overuse, their ""noise"". A new term for it, ""media fatigue"" has emerged: we can't be everywhere and we're exhausted from reporting all the stories, they argue. The Guardian has recently launched its new online magazine, ""The World Today"" and the Guardian website's new ""storyroom"", ""the Guardian View"", has become a hot topic on the Twitter micro-blogging network, Twitter, with users, in one word: ""no.""

The problem with ""no"" is not so much the sound of it but its very idea: the idea of journalists having the right to not report something, to refuse to publish something.

There's no such right, and if there was it would be an un-British, undemocratic notion that the British press is above the law, above the common good, above the interests of citizens, above the freedoms that have defined us as a free society since our nation was founded in 1707. The right to ""no"" is, in short, the wrong thing.

"""It was the same with the movie,"" said one woman.

""I felt so sorry for my mother, the one who would never know the true value of the gifts she gave her children, that she could not look her children in the face. It's sad but true,"" said another woman.

A third woman, who also wanted to remain anonymous, said, ""I feel the same way.""

""The way they treat people like this is completely unacceptable,"" she said.

A number of the women, who came to the hospital for their yearly physical exams, said the doctor had made comments to them about their weight and the way they looked, while one of them recalled that she had been told ""to keep it up"" by another doctor.

A representative of the hospital confirmed that the woman's complaints had been brought to its attention, adding that the hospital was conducting its own internal investigation into the incident.

A spokeswoman for the Health Ministry said, however, that there were no complaints regarding the physical examination by a female doctor in the last couple of months, adding that she had no details to provide at the moment.

In February this year, the Ministry of Health released the results of a nationwide survey in which"
"""There's an important lesson that comes out of this case,"" said Mark Bederow, the general counsel for the International Society of Legal Services. ""In order for this kind of service to work, people must trust that they will get justice. If the court can't prove they'll be treated fairly, there will be a very difficult time for them. It will be harder to get justice and more expensive.

""That is one of the problems with our court system — there is not an adversarial process,"" Mr. Bederow added.

But lawyers have another view: the problem with our justice system is not the process. The problem is the results. The court's ability to render justice has been undermined by the lack of impartiality, they say.

""It's a good lesson,"" said Robert Smith, a partner at the firm Smith & Gordon. ""What happens if a jury acquits a person, but there was not an unbiased trial?""

He cited the case of John A. Burris, a retired engineer in New York City. The city's insurance department charged Mr. Burris in 1989 with failing to provide a proper level of car repair and insurance coverage, according to a complaint that he later filed in federal"

The second task for the scientists, who have spent more than three years on the project, was to map the vast space of the ocean floor with the highest-resolution sonar, then find and drill the best target to collect samples from.

Dr. Scott Waring, an oceanographer with the University of New England and a lead researcher, said he hoped the research would help explain some of the mystery around how much carbon was being stored in the world's oceans and the processes by which it was moving between them.

""I don't know what it tells us about the state of the oceans at any particular moment,"" he said. ""It's not as if we have all of this data about where all the carbon is stored.""

"In this episode we speak to Professor Adam Felling. Professor Felling has worked for over 40 years in the area of health psychology and has written over 60 articles. He is an international expert on the subject of anxiety and the author of over 70 peer reviewed research papers and over 100 books and papers on this topic. Adam also lectures on anxiety and related issues and has a great video series on this subject: ""Why do people with anxiety get stressed?""

Adam's work on this subject is important for several reasons. It helps us understand how the mind works in healthy people and also why we can get so anxious and anxious-prone. For example, how does a normal person with normal life circumstances end up getting so stressed? In our own personal experiences, Adam has helped us see the signs that may signal that something is wrong and what to do about them.

We also discuss how the fear of failure may lead us into over-optimism about our chances. This may result in our making more plans than we actually need. In turn, we end up setting ourselves up for failure, which causes more anxiety and anxiety-related stress. This may lead us to avoid failure altogether. This is a problem for entrepreneurs too – what is a person with anxiety doing with"

"""He had no intention to do anything,"" says his cousin, Robert F. Brown.

The murder was never solved, and no one has been held accountable. The killer, now dead, left his family no answers and no peace.

Now, Brown and the victim's sister are pressing the state attorney's office for information. The case is still unsolved.

""The last thing you want is a closure and you want justice,"" Brown said.

In June 2011, Robert F. Brown's cousin, Robert Brown, was shot in the chest during an argument in his driveway on South Third Street in Cleveland Heights. He was 28.

He survived, but was in critical condition. He'd lost an eye in the shooting and the bullet still remained in his lung, he told detectives.

Investigators searched for more than two months for the suspect, and for an arrest warrant, but no one came forward, the cousins say.

A few months later, Brown's wife called her mother in Miami and said he had died of an apparent overdose.

""He was on a lot of pain killers,"" Brown said. ""I believe that he died because of the pain pills, and not from a gun.""

"In a move that will see a total of more than 40,000 students being taken from their school in the next five years, the state's largest school system has announced its intention to cut funding to about 80 of the most needy schools, and possibly hundreds of others.

The plan will see more than 30,000 students, or more than 10 percent of the schools in the system, losing funding to the end of the school year.

""This will mean we are going to close a school,"" Superintendent David Carver said.

Carver says that many schools have been under-enrolled for years and that they need additional staff to deal with a growing population of students.

""If we had more staff, we could be better at managing those children who have special needs,"" he said.

The schools losing funding will include about 80 high-poverty schools that are known as ""priority"" schools, meaning they have been identified by the state for particular issues.

The districts losing the most money include the East Baltimore Schools, which have already had a reduction in their state aid this school year. They're also losing about $15 million this school year.

"If you haven't read the article on this blog about how the last decade or so of global warming was caused by the Sun and nothing else, it's well worth the time to do so.

The article has been referenced many times and the results have been interesting, to say the least. But there has been no discussion of what we do know.

We know that the Sun and other natural factors cause temperature change and it has been this fact for hundreds of years, perhaps millions, depending on who you ask. But why is it important?

There is no doubt that the Earth has warmed and that this change has caused much of the biodiversity destruction we have witnessed in recent decades. It has caused a number of droughts in various regions, as well as wildfires. But does that mean that global warming is to blame for all these changes?

Not necessarily, for at least some of them can be attributed to other natural factors such as ocean currents or ocean temperature changes, as well as man-made greenhouse gas emissions.

It's time that this simple fact was brought into the open and discussed more often. The debate around global warming is not simply about what it causes, but what we do to deal with the impacts of climate change"

"In an interview with The Guardian, the British politician said the European Union's policy of allowing member states to pursue a national interest by ""stripping back the regulatory power"" of national regulators in the bloc would ultimately lead to ""the complete fragmentation"" of Europe's economy and lead to more conflict in Europe's internal markets.

He argued that Britain should be in a stronger position than France in negotiating a better trade deal with the US because its government is in control of trade policy and the ability of its government to intervene in the economy to improve competitiveness would be diminished by EU regulations.

""I would prefer to negotiate with a strong hand because if I am negotiating with the weak hand it is a different game and the other players get the chance to have a say,"" said Davis, the Conservative minister who led the Brexit talks with EU partners Michel Barnier.

He argued that Britain would not have the ability to take measures that were counter-productive in Europe and would therefore find itself at the mercy of European countries like Germany who have more powerful negotiating positions.

A new breed of industrial designer has been born in recent years, as engineers, architects and industrial designers alike have taken up the task of redesigning our cities and our homes. From the rise of 'urban designers', who work to build urban environments for a new age, to the growing number of people in urban planning programmes and the use of design principles to build more energy efficient buildings, there seems to be no stopping this new breed.

But it is the small group of urban designers that are setting themselves apart in a world increasingly obsessed with the big picture and with 'doing the right thing'. These urban designers, many of them self-taught, are building their own projects in the world's urban centres. In London they are the team behind the Design Studio and its first exhibition, Design by Numbers.

The aim of the show is to challenge the idea of 'design as process', as opposed to a product of design, and to show the impact that a diverse range of approaches can have"
"The FBI said Friday that a new device discovered in an FBI laboratory last week contained enough plutonium for ""a handful"" of bombs and ""is one of a series of highly sensitive plutonium-related devices"" uncovered during a two-year probe that began with the 2010 death of a worker at an Albuquerque uranium mine.

""It's not an insignificant quantity,"" FBI agent Brian McClusky, the lead on the investigation into the bomb plot, said in an interview Friday. He added that ""a handful of devices"" is an ""adequate estimate.""

The bomb's discovery is the latest development in an ongoing probe that has rocked Albuquerque, N.M. Since 2011, a pair of workers at the West Los Angeles nuclear power plant, a Department of Energy research facility near Carlsbad and an FBI lab near Albuquerque were killed.

The first bomb was found on Aug. 21, 2012, during a routine cleaning of the facility's storage tank by the lab's hazardous materials team, the Albuquerque Journal reported at the time.

The second bomb was found on Aug. 20, 2013, when a technician from the FBI lab was inspecting the West Los Angeles facility, the newspaper said. The man had gone inside to use the bathroom but discovered that an internal"
"""What if a new game console has an in-game cash shop where you can spend real-world cash?""

That's a question I had while watching Microsoft's Xbox One reveal. After seeing a game on the TV screen where I was able to pay for something by pressing a button in real-life, I couldn't help but ask if such a system was in development.

As a developer and consumer of video games, I have no idea what it's like to work on the team of a major gaming company and be told about the existence of this system, but I'd guess it's similar to working with an established technology company, which may or may not be an Apple-esque tech-bro paradise.

When we work on our products, we can be confident that our efforts are well-received. However, if you are working on the product and are not a member of a large game development company, there is a risk of a bad reaction if the product isn't good enough, which is a major concern in today's market.

"If you haven't had your fill of the most expensive baseball game in baseball history, or if you are one of the lucky few who bought tickets for the game in person, this is a good opportunity to revisit some of the most amazing plays from that game, and some of the greatest catches, baserunners and home runs from all-time.

On Tuesday night, a bunch of people got their money's worth from baseball, with the Mets' 7-1 loss to the Cleveland Indians a day before it was to be played, on Wednesday.

There are plenty of memorable moments, and a lot of memorable moments from the game, so if you want to get into it, here are a few highlights to start.

Curtis Granderson's Home Run

You may remember the catch that happened in the seventh inning of the game, as Curtis Granderson caught the ball as it fell between his legs and made an amazing grab of it for a home run. It was one of those plays where it doesn't look like the catch was much, but you know what, Granderson didn't really get the ball. He actually made the catch after getting a leg down.

"It is a common practice for many parents to try and prevent their kids from spending money on toys by putting them into a box of cheap, low-value toys. But research has shown that this method of protecting kids is often counterproductive, and even detrimental, because it makes it easier for children to start to spend money.

To test the theory, the authors of a new paper in the journal Economics of Education Review examined data on purchases in a California county by the average 13-year-old student between 1998 and 2004, and found that, overall, the children in this study had increased spending by an average of about $7 per month on toys from age 1 to 5. However, this spending increase did not come as a surprise, and in fact, was somewhat surprising considering the results of earlier research by economists Jeffrey R. Tucker and Thomas Sargent that suggested that parents should be cautious when trying to control the amount of spending on children's toys.

Mr. Bechtle said he was troubled that the agency had been unable to locate all of the documents in its possession on the agency's own and that the department was unable to determine whether they had been produced by the White House. He said that he was also troubled that some documents that were found were ""unrelated to the original investigation.""

The department also did not provide Mr. Bechtle's letter to the committee with all of its references, and it withheld a copy of Mr. Bechtle's letter in part because he said the department was still working out some of his concerns.

In a letter to Mr. Bechtle on Thursday, Representative Henry A. Waxman, the committee chairman, said, ""There is much I cannot share at this point, and it is imperative that the agency address those remaining questions in order for us to complete our inquiry and ensure compliance with the law.""

The investigation by the House committee is a high-profile example of a"
"A year after the state passed legislation that allows doctors to refuse treatment for any reason, some patients are finding a way to keep getting care.

For more than two weeks, doctors and other health care providers in Texas have been barred from refusing to treat patients for ""life-threatening illnesses."" That law was enacted in May 2013 after a federal appeals court struck down the Texas law's ban on ""conscience protection,"" which prevents doctors from objecting to treating patients because they believe that the patient is going to die in a matter of hours or days. The federal law's protections were supposed to apply to any doctor.

The law's passage, and implementation, were marred by controversy, as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and others argued that the law's protections would violate patients' First Amendment right to practice religion, as well as a federal law prohibiting discrimination in the sale and delivery of health care. The federal judge who heard the case also argued that the law violated patients' equal protection under the 14th Amendment.

Last month, a panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion upholding the law. It upheld the law as ""narrowly tailored"" to the needs of a medically fragile patient population. But the majority of the judges"
"We've been keeping you updated on our work in progress for a while, so you're probably all well aware that the upcoming 2.2 release of Ubuntu Linux (aka, Unity) is shaping up nicely.

With that said, we thought you might be interested to hear how the new Ubuntu Touch mobile OS has progressed in the meantime.

In short, the platform is doing very well indeed, but there is one small thing that is still to come in the form of Unity 8 on top.

So far, we have seen Unity 8 being ported to more platforms (e.g. Windows 10), and the code base is stable. However, it is still in early days for this particular release, and some changes could happen at any point in time, so we recommend using our 1.4.1-0ubuntu14.04-server images at your own risk.

"As of Wednesday morning, the two largest federal student loans are being held up as collateral for a bank account belonging to an alleged fugitive, the Department of Justice said in a court filing on Wednesday.

According to a criminal complaint, the loan holders are John Henry Browne and Kevin Wayne Brown of Brooklyn, who were indicted last year for their role in an alleged $10 million scheme that laundered more than $600 million of federal student loan proceeds. The government alleged the pair laundered the funds by taking the loan payments directly out of bank accounts.

""It's just an embarrassment to the entire system that these loans were not secured with anything like a lien, so we can't just hold on to these loans until the day of our sentencing,"" Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell told The Daily Caller. ""If you're not going to get it done by then, why don't you give them up for sale and take the risk.""

Brown and Browne were indicted along with another individual, Kevin M. Clark, and the pair have been accused of being members of the same scheme to defraud the U.S. Department of Education and its borrowers.

In October 2016, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Brown, Browne and Clark with wire"

"BARCELONA -- On the final day of Barcelona's pre-season tour, Neymar told the club's media he's excited for what he'll get up to in his new surroundings and that he'll ""definitely have an influence"" on the team's success this season.

""The pre-season is over. Now we go to play, and I hope I will have an impact in this new project we're working on,"" Neymar told reporters after a team-bonding session on the eve of Barcelona's friendly with Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday night.

The Brazilian forward is still on holiday, but he did take time to give an interview to Spanish newspaper Mundo Deportivo on Sunday night. He told reporters he has no doubt that the new signings will make Barcelona more competitive next season, even if the squad hasn't had much of an impact since he was sold to Paris Saint-Germain for £200m last summer.

"In this edition of our series ""What is your biggest mistake when you started a new venture?"", I've chosen a new company with an innovative technology and I have to confess I'm a little scared by them.

So what is my biggest mistake? It is that I haven't put in my two cents of value on them and that has already cost me.

The problem

I've decided to join them and I want to make my first mistake easy for me and the people who will be following this company.

So here it goes:

1) I'm going to put in my money in the form of equity

2) I will keep a 50/50 split

3) I will keep it for two years, until they go public.

What if I want to buy my own share after two years? Well, you can't, as that would be selling the company and would make me liable to a 100% capital gains tax on that profit.

This means that I have to buy a new stake for two years, so my net equity investment is:

"It's no surprise to see that the United States, Canada, Mexico and other countries are working toward a unified currency.

It's the latest in a long series of measures designed to bolster the global economy's competitiveness. But what would that look like, and would it make life better for everyone?

""There is an economic rationale for a single currency. If we were all trading freely on the international markets, the result would be higher prices for everybody,"" says Charles Plosser, an international economist with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

""You're going to end up with more goods, and you'll have higher incomes,"" Plosser says, ""which in turn leads to a better quality of life for everyone.""

Why the U.S., Mexico, Canada, the U.K., France, Germany, Switzerland, Japan and others want a common currency

"In the early 1970s, an American government agent called a special task force of agents, and a few journalists.

This task force was responsible for the biggest investigation in the history of the US government, a task force which involved hundreds of FBI agents, CIA officers and hundreds of others working in multiple fields to try to understand how the Watergate scandal got so huge, and so wrong, so fast.

This team worked on two main strands:

1. How was the Watergate scandal allowed to grow to such proportions?

2. Who did it, and what did they want from the White House?

They had their work cut out.

The investigation was the biggest, most ambitious operation ever undertaken in the US, with over 400 agents.

In this article we'll examine how this investigation happened, and what lessons were learned for how the world deals with big corruption today.

Who did it?

"BOULDER, Colo. — In a historic moment, Colorado voters legalized marijuana in a statewide vote Tuesday that supporters say could create the first state in the country to do so by a landslide margin.

But opponents of marijuana legalization say it was only a matter of time before Colorado became the latest battleground in a national trend to allow people to use pot, regardless of federal laws that still treat pot as a drug with no medical value.

Initiative 200, the initiative that won 55 percent of the vote, makes Colorado the third state to legalize recreational use of pot and could pave the way for others to do the same. The first was Washington and Oregon, in the last few weeks of November, and the second was Alaska last year.

""I think Colorado will be a bellwether for what is happening nationwide,"" said Ethan Nadelmann, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, a New York-based advocacy group. ""Initiatives and ballot initiatives will continue to proliferate and be successful. … If you think this is the last frontier for legalization, I think you're dreaming.""

Proponents of Initiative 200 said it is an example of voters being ""willing to step out of their comfort zone,"" but also pointed out"

"""We will be a safe harbor for people from the Islamic Republic of Iran to go to Canada.""

— Donald Trump, in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Aug. 10, 2015

The first sentence is misleading because Trump never actually promised that. It is simply what he said in his interview.

But it was misleading enough for a reader to email the campaign for clarification.

In fact, the candidate made no such promise, nor did he say it was possible for Iran to visit Canada without obtaining special permission from the Trump administration.

A senior policy adviser to Trump's campaign told us in a phone call that Trump's statements were misstated by the media and the Clinton campaign.

""We are going to have a policy of acceptance. We are going to be a safe harbor for people from the Islamic Republic of Iran to go to Canada. And if we ever had a problem with people who want to travel, if they had trouble getting through our airport or whatever, they're not going to have trouble coming here,"" said Stephen Miller, the campaign adviser.

Here are the facts.

"The number of new apartments that have been completed or announced for completion this year is far above what is expected in a healthy economy, the San Francisco-based developer behind one of San Francisco's hottest new projects says.

At its new 1-million-square-foot Westfield Montgomery Street project, the developers behind the building and others around the Bay Area have begun to take construction estimates from the state and federal governments, said San Francisco-based developer Transwestern Partners, which has the Montgomery Street project on track for a groundbreaking next week.

""The reason is there is not enough new construction to replace existing construction that is coming down, and so there are only going to be about 12,000 more units built over the next three years in the Bay Area than there was three years ago,"" Transwestern partner Robert Guenther said in a recent interview. ""There's been no construction activity here since 2010.""

The lack of construction is not only creating an imbalance between the supply and demand in San Francisco and other Bay Area markets, but is also costing taxpayers, because of a backlog of building permit applications and construction delays.

According to Transwestern's most recent state tax revenue estimate, the average San Francisco apartment price in December was $1,"

"This is the moment an armed police officer opened fire at an elderly woman with dementia and left her fighting for her life after a confrontation on the Tube.

The pensioner had been watching television at Aldgate in south-west London at 8pm when police stormed into her home.

But they failed to take action against a woman who they suspected of being an alcoholic - even after the pensioner's daughter complained.

A Metropolitan police spokesman said: 'Police attended reports of an assault at 8pm on July 18 in an area known for heavy drinking.

"It was a dramatic ending to the third presidential debate Tuesday, which left Republican candidate Mitt Romney trailing by nine percentage points and President Obama ahead by about 5.8 percentage points. The candidates' responses to a series of questions on national security and the economy was the main storyline.

Obama, the first president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be trailing his opponent in the polls in November, faced tough questions about his record on terrorism, his handling of the economy, the federal debt, and foreign policy. He also was questioned about the Romney campaign's refusal to release its tax returns, a major point of contention during the primary race between Obama and Romney.

Romney, in a bid to win the race for the nomination, also came under scrutiny for a speech at the conservative Values Voters Summit, which he delivered last year and in which he spoke favorably of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and made references to a ""birther"" conspiracy theory.

""This election's gonna come down to one issue. That issue is jobs,"" Obama said.

""That's the issue, is how are you going to help our middle class get jobs?"" Romney shot back. ""This is not the first time you've said things you later said were wrong.""

Ms. Reiss and Mr. White's daughters were in the family room watching a movie on TV. Her husband had come in a little late to pick up some food from a convenience store and they had gone into the bedroom. She had never heard from Mr. White, and had assumed that he was still in bed, waiting for her.

Mr. White's family said he was shot by his estranged wife, who was upset because he was still married to Ms. Reiss's sister and was not living together.

The family has not yet determined exactly how or where the shooting happened. They suspect that the bullet from Ms. Reiss's gun went into her husband's head, then ricocheted off the ceiling. They said it could have been from any number of positions: on the floor, from above, from under a pillow, on the floor again or in his chest.

"MILFORD -- Police are looking for the owner of a small, yellow and red Toyota pickup truck that was used as a getaway car in an armed robbery at the CVS in the South Milford Town Center parking lot on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.

Police received a 911 call about 2 p.m. regarding the armed robbery in progress, Lt. Gary D. Woodbury of the Milford Police Department said in a statement. The suspect, described as a man with a white T-shirt, a beard, black hair, and a large belly, drove off in the truck with two female hostages and then left in an unknown direction, Woodbury said.

The incident prompted an intense police and mallwide manhunt. Milford Police and mall security personnel conducted an extensive search of the South Milford Town Center, Milford Town Center Plaza, and nearby parking lots, according to a news release from Milford Town Center. Milford Police Department SWAT teams searched the parking lot from the northbound ramp onto State Road 7 to the eastbound parking ramp at the shopping center. Milford Town Center personnel, along with several other state police units and other town officers, were involved in an extensive search of the mall parking lots and parking areas."
"MELBOURNE Victory coach Ange Postecoglou says the club are pleased to announce they have signed Brazilian forward Rafael de Silva.

The 26-year-old former Inter Milan star has joined Victory for a fee believed to be about $2 million, having agreed terms with the A-League champions last month.

De Silva will make his Victory debut when he takes to the field for his team in tomorrow night's A-League clash with Newcastle Jets at Etihad Stadium.

He joins the Victory for a year on a four-year deal and the club is excited by what he brings to the club.

""It is always great when players want to come to the A-League, it shows the calibre of player they are,"" Postecoglou said.

""The opportunity to be part of an organisation of the size of Melbourne Victory and playing for a club as prestigious as Victory, I can't wait.""

The Brazilian international will link up with the squad in Sydney tonight for the international break."
"In this series, we look at how a few of the world's greatest musicians, actors and writers came up with their famous songs. In Part One, we examine the influences and origins of ""Flamenco,"" ""Smooth Criminal,"" and ""Ain't Misbehavin'.""

There are no rules, only free will

We all know this lyric from a popular song from the 80's. I'm not going to get into all of the details of what happened between the recording and release of ""Smooth Criminal."" Suffice to say, the song was a massive success and is one of my favorite tracks from the band, who had already been popular in the early 80's. What I'll do is discuss how one of the best musicians of his time, Steve Cropper, came up with his iconic version of the song, ""Ain't Misbehavin'.""

Cropper's ""Smooth Criminal"" was originally a single for a local band called ""The Four Tops,"" but when that band folded, he took over as lead guitarist, replacing Tommy Lee, and put the song out as his solo song, and the first to chart at number 1 on Billboard's R&B charts. Steve's version of the song"
"""We are working closely with our government partners to determine how to address this matter, but in the meantime we ask for your understanding,"" said the email to its customers, sent out in English and Arabic, with an English version posted on Facebook.

The news has drawn widespread outrage on social media.

The company, founded in 1990, has grown to a sprawling company with more than 600 employees, a global customer base, and a fleet of ships that has moved cargo between countries.

A company representative confirmed the incident and said in an emailed statement that the company is cooperating with investigators.

The company has about 90 days to complete its internal investigation. The company, based in Singapore, has a global fleet of about 35 vessels, including at least one vessel based in Dubai.

A spokesman for the Dubai Ministry of Water and Electricity said the vessel, owned by M/s Dainese Group, was due to depart the city's Jebel Ali port for Port Said, Egypt on the morning of June 9, when the incident took place.

He said the ministry had instructed the port to conduct an immediate inspection and take ""necessary measures to safeguard public health.""

Kruse's representative is Melbourne Victory and Kruse's current manager and agent Mark Bosnich.

The pair have worked closely together for many years and Victory is hoping to tie the former Adelaide United forward to the club in a move that will improve on their efforts in last season's trade period to bring Carney and Shinji Ono.

Bosnich told The Herald Sun the deal was progressing quickly.

""He's happy here and is keen to move forward. There are a couple of clubs that have expressed interest in Robbie and he has also been contacted by some other clubs in the league, so we will have to see what happens,"" he said.

""I don't know if they have approached him about it or if he has been approached by other clubs in the league. But he has expressed an interest to join the Victory.""

Kruse is out of contract at Adelaide on June 30 but will be available on a free transfer to any club who qualifies.

"""If the president's going to have to fire everybody, the sooner the better. You're not going to do this forever, but sooner or later he's got to figure out where he wants to be.""

- House Speaker Paul Ryan

On the night of the first 2016 Republican presidential primary debate, the conservative House speaker of Wisconsin said Donald Trump and other Republicans would have to fire everybody to be elected to the White House.

Ryan said that when Trump became the GOP front-runner in March, ""I thought, 'Well, he'll just grow out of it.'"" But by mid-April, Ryan told NBC News that the ""toxic level"" of Trump's comments were too much for his colleagues in Congress to bear.

The comments came as the Republican National Committee announced that it would no longer pay for Trump's primary campaign after it came to light that Trump had made anti-immigrant statements. Trump had used a similar language as the speaker did.

As for whether he'd have to fire everybody if the party had a contested convention in Cleveland, Ryan told CNN that it was ""not something I'm planning for at all.""

The House speaker told Fox Business Network on Sunday, however, that ""I'm going to"

"MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's top sports official was arrested Wednesday and charged with running a corrupt sports-book operation.

A judge issued an arrest warrant for Jose Maria Marin, the sports secretary at the Mexico Football Association. Marin's attorney, Maria Jesus Vasquez, says the charge is baseless. Marin was on his way to a conference call with reporters, when he was detained in a federal police vehicle.

The arrest warrant said that Marin has ""conspired"" to fix soccer games in Mexico City and that he is suspected of ""deliberately manipulating the price of tickets sold by sports organizers"" at the expense of fans.

""In a way, this case has nothing to do with sports,"" said Vasquez.

A criminal complaint said Marin has been involved with the soccer-book business since 2002 and ""has a long history of illegal activities in connection with the use of illegal ticket resellers in connection with the resale of tickets for the purposes of sports betting and gaming.""

The first thing you do is put the TV on mute. Then you get on Facebook. And then you go to the local library, where you find an interesting book on the topic of gender, sexuality and race, and you buy it. You start to think about all the movies you've seen this year and how you could change them to be more inclusive and more respectful of those who have traditionally been marginalized in American media.

You buy more books on this subject, and you start to learn that gender is more fluid than you think. And that sexuality is less black and white. And you start to realize that racism, homophobia and other forms of prejudice exist. You learn to love books for being full of ideas and to understand the importance of critical thinking in the fight for social justice. You become an avid reader.

"This article originally appeared in The National Interest.

A year ago, on April 1, Russia annexed the Crimea—a move that sparked global protests, which in turn sparked sanctions and sanctions, which in turn sparked an international response. And then the Obama administration issued an Executive Order imposing additional sanctions against Russian entities and individuals. The list was extensive and included Russian military officials and banks, and included a few people with direct links to the Putin government—including several top Putin cronies. But it did not include Putin himself.

As I pointed out at the time, there were a few plausible arguments against singling out Putin and barring his participation in any aspect of American politics: Putin may be an incompetent despot but that is not an excuse to deprive him of the right to speak out in the U.S. He has done little harm, and, in the short run at least, has been helpful to the United States by allowing the West to impose crippling economic sanctions against Iran and North Korea, which Putin was instrumental in bringing to bear on those nations.

Yet now it turns out that there are reasons to do so, which will surprise many readers who might be surprised at the prospect that the U.S. would actually punish someone for political speech."
"The top-five draft prospects are a little thinner at quarterback this week as a pair of 2014 first-rounders and another 2014 third-rounder all chose their teams.

Athletes in their first full college seasons often have the most difficulty in determining who's worthy of a top selection in April's draft. In addition to a strong set of quarterbacks who entered this week as early favorites, several more under-the-radar candidates, like Miami's Stephen Morris, are likely to make the move to the second day.

But this is also the week the first round is scheduled to get under way, with five teams scheduled to start their first round on April 25: Alabama (4), Florida State (1), Texas A&M (6), Alabama (8), and Baylor (13). The top two selections are likely to be quarterbacks.

The quarterback rankings in the first round of the NFL Draft will likely change based on which of the two first-round picks selected will be playing this week, but for now the first-round rankings are a snapshot of who's been garnering attention this spring.

A first-round quarterback could be available at No. 23. If he is, this could be a great week for those hoping"
"The Washington Post is out with its new profile on White House press secretary Sean Spicer, with an opening shot in which he refers to President Donald Trump's frequent calls with world leaders as ""very much a work in progress.""

The piece, titled ""Inside the West Wing,"" opens with Spicer saying he ""took some heat"" after referring to Trump's phone calls to world leaders as ""presidential"" or ""presidential calls"" — an apparent jab at former president Barack Obama.

Spicer later told NBC's ""Today"" that his description was taken out of context and he didn't intend to criticize the former president, who frequently engaged in a ""brief"" conversation with foreign leaders while in office.

Here are some highlights of the report from the Washington Post, including Spicer's first words of the piece:

The press secretary, who took over after Reince Priebus's resignation, said the Trump administration has not been given the ""full complement of ambassadorships,"" and has had to scramble for replacements, sometimes picking up to eight or more in the same period of time. Spicer said that it can be a difficult transition from campaign to the White House. He described the job of being a press secretary as being a ""gut feeling"""

We always loved to celebrate.""

That was the last time we ever spoke, in the weeks after he died. He had a heart attack that morning, and it took several days to tell the world his passing, but that day was his last day. His body was found at home by his family members on May 20.

"""In my experience, it is difficult for any manager to give 100 per cent,"" says Jose Mourinho, a manager with whom I spoke on Monday morning in his office at the United Football Club in Stretford.

It is an assessment he would doubtless have made had his own team won the league that year – it would have been his first as Manchester United's manager and his first as the club's owner, too – but the Portuguese was clearly on the road to a more relaxed conclusion of his season-long conversation, one which included an analysis of how his own teams have been doing since his appointment on 31 July last year.

United had finished a point behind leaders City last term, yet were the surprise package in the Champions League semi-finals and reached the quarter-final of the Premier League with the help of an unexpected draw at home against Stoke City, in the absence of a host of senior players, and a manager who has since been hailed by Sir Alex Ferguson for the manner in which his squad have embraced the change.

""It has been a very interesting year, from my point of view,"" said Mourinho of the second half of his tenure so far. ""In terms of my philosophy, the club and the fans have supported it."
"""If I was a rich man, I'd do what you guys are doing and take out the insurance company,"" the Republican candidate for president said. | AP Photo Trump on 'bail-in'

Republican front-runner Donald Trump told supporters Saturday that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is ""getting away with murder.""

The comments were an apparent reference to a bill in Congress, which the GOP presidential frontrunner said he supported. The measure, introduced last month, would force the FDIC to give up control over certain banking assets, like insurance on bank deposits and other assets, to a bipartisan commission. The bill also calls for Congress to impose new requirements for FDIC insured banks to have a higher capital level, which the bank has already had to adopt.

"In this blog post I'm going to go over what we have learnt so far from our 3 years of data science work in our company and how we will approach it for the upcoming 4.

Let's begin

The Data Scientist role

As a data scientist, your role will be to make decisions and to implement them in order to create and evaluate the most suitable strategy to achieve your company's goal.

There are different kinds of decisions a data scientist can make. The following is the most important:

A. Choosing between strategies and choosing a solution to achieve your business goal.

B. Implementing a strategy.

C. Analyzing and making recommendations regarding a solution to achieve your business goal.

Choosing a solution

Once we've chosen a solution we will need to determine its feasibility, i.e., it needs to work as well as we can make it work. We can measure this using many methods including the following:

A. Test your hypothesis

B. Perform an experiment

C. Analyze data

D. Draw conclusions from your data.

The important thing here is to keep the process as short and as transparent as possible. If the experiment does not"

President Obama will return to D.C. next month for his second presidential trip as commander in chief.

Obama's first visit to D.C. came during the 2008 presidential campaign and came after the Democratic convention when Obama gave a speech that many remember.

His last trip was in April 2015 when Obama spoke in Charleston, W.Va., to mark the dedication of a new Confederate monument at the state Capitol.

The president will give the keynote address to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People National Conference.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, is the keynote speaker, while President Obama will be joined by first lady Michelle Obama, who was a guest of D.C. Mayor Bowser last month.

D.C. has not had an inauguration ceremony in nearly 30 years, since Jimmy Carter's in 1977. The city has had a mayor for more than six decades.

In his speech, Obama is expected to emphasize that the United States ""must rise to meet our challenges. It is"

"We know the general election will be in the fall of 2020 and we've got plenty of time for that to be settled, but what happens after that? We can only hope it doesn't get out of hand.

One of the big things I'm working on now is how to make it so the election isn't held every year.

In theory, if you vote every election you would get the same results in 2020 and after, because it wouldn't be necessary for people to be holding an election to decide how to vote in every single year. But this would make it much, much more likely for things to be a lot more fluid and volatile in the interim.

What do we need to do about this? The first thing I would do is create a system for making elections in every country the same, but different elections to vote for different governments. The election that's held after 2020 could then be called for any government of any kind to be voted in, and if people are happy with what government that's going to be, they could choose to stay with it and not bother with an election for a new government.

There would still be the same general election, of course. But it could be called for any government or no government"

"If you've been keeping up with the news, you've heard that a new bill in California could lead to a crackdown on so-called ""sanctuary cities,"" or places that restrict how police can access immigration status data.

But in many cases, those cities don't actually have any laws in place restricting law enforcement from asking for immigration status, says Rebecca Keiller, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project.

""We're not going to be able to hold any sanctuary jurisdictions accountable,"" says Keiller. ""There are just not many of those jurisdictions around the country.""

It's unclear whether SB 54 will have the teeth it needs to make the difference in cities that don't restrict police from asking about immigration status.

California, which already has one of the strictest sanctuary laws in the country, already bans law enforcement agencies from inquiring about immigration status without a warrant, or unless a judge gives approval.

In California, it's not enough for police to merely ask a person's immigration status, they must provide documentation from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

"It was the second day of a trial that could result in a former top adviser to former president Barack Obama pleading guilty to violating campaign finance law and admitting that he conspired to hide $65 million in assets in foreign banks and shelters, the Justice Department said Tuesday.

Juan Mendez pleaded guilty Tuesday to a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering and two counts of bank fraud.

Mendez, an aide to Obama when he was the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, will be sentenced May 12, when prosecutors have to report whether he accepted a plea bargain. He has agreed to forfeit about $12.6 million.

If he accepted the plea agreement, it could result in a sentence of five years in prison. If the judge doesn't accept the deal, the case could go to trial and Mendez could be sentenced to 20 years in prison.

In an interview Tuesday with The Associated Press, Mendez, 51, said he has already agreed to a guilty plea but wouldn't go into details.

He said the charges he faced were not a surprise because his case has been pending since September 2015.

The charges against him stem from a conspiracy dating back to 2006, when the former adviser's wife and a longtime"
"In a new survey of 5,000 students and 1,500 parents by the New York-based advocacy group The Education Trust, only 15% of students in high-poverty schools reported getting any type of school lunch. The average daily cost to those students: $29.

That's about $10 less per meal than students at private schools and nearly $20 less per day than the national average of $47, the organization found. The lowest-performing students also get a larger portion of their lunch money for lunch.

In a statement, the school food service industry, which represents school food providers and operators, said its employees have worked for more than 20 years to ""raise standards, improve quality, and lower costs,"" while improving ""student nutrition and nutrition education"" to better prepare children for success in school.

But some advocates argue that while school cafeterias have improved nutrition standards over time, the costs are not necessarily making a dent.

The report also found that schools with the most expensive and lowest-performing foods served to students in 2013 cost about the same, while the top 10 percent of schools had a gap between the two.

"BOGOTA (Reuters) - The head of Colombia's police force on Wednesday condemned an attack on the Colombian ambassador's car, in which he said four of his officers were injured, in an incident that has stoked tensions in a region wracked by drug trafficking.

The attack, which was condemned by the police chief in a separate incident on Tuesday, raised fears of more violent protests after a year of deadly clashes between security forces and the powerful criminal gangs in which dozens have been killed.

President Juan Manuel Santos condemned the assault on the ambassador, Jose Antonio Cabrera, in a statement issued after Cabrera and two police officers were treated for minor wounds and released from a local hospital.

""It is with profound sadness, pain, indignation and anger that I condemn the cowardly and unjust act committed by a few criminals and thugs in an attempt to assassinate our ambassador, in addition to those who have been wounded in the attack,"" he said in the statement, referring to Cabrera's attackers as ""criminals.""

The Creative Mind

You've got the brains, now you've got the creative power to put your ideas into action. You're a master of the written word and an artist who is capable of bringing your visions to life in a variety of media, but the most important aspect of your creative ability is how well you work with your team and the resources you have available.

Working in an organization with an open, creative environment will give you access to people with a wide range of experience. Working in a creative environment can also allow you to be a more productive worker. As a creative worker, your goal is to find ways to apply your knowledge and skill sets in ways that you find most helpful. You should never feel as though your contributions to an organization are ""incomplete"", as this could create an environment where people are too hesitant to contribute.

The NFL Network reported that the team plans to cut the 28-year-old cornerback and replace him with free-agent pickup P.J. Williams. The move could be a temporary one, as the team may be willing to give Breaux another year.

Breaux, who signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Saints last offseason, was placed on injured reserve for the third straight year. The 6-foot, 205-pound cornerback is in his fifth year in the NFL, but his time on the sideline may be coming to an end.

Breaux had two interceptions, two passes defended, two pass break-ups, two forced fumbles and a fumble recovery. The team's first-round pick in 2010, he appeared in 15 games over his first two years, with two starts. He missed the last seven games of 2014 because of a concussion.

Almater (アーマスター, Āmateru?) is an antagonist featured in Vento Aureo.

Appearance Edit

Almater appears as a large humanoid that appears to have an oval head with long pointed ears and long legs with claws on the front and back of each foot. He is a slim, blue humanoid with black markings all over his face, which are very reminiscent of those found on the Octoroks.

Personality Edit

Almater is shown to be very arrogant, as shown when he ordered the other members of the Octoroks to fight each other while he remained unaffected by their attacks and did nothing about their actions.

History Edit

Past Edit

When he was still in the sea of Nibel, Almater was first seen by Octorok pilots when they encountered him in the waters, which they attacked as a means of trying to drive him out. He was seen later on as the leader of the Octoroks who were searching for their lost leader. After learning about his death, they set off in search of a new leader."
"As part of his effort to convince Congress that it should renew the Patriot Act, President Obama asked members of his cabinet on Friday to support the extension. ""I urge you to act quickly,"" Obama wrote to his top aides, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, State Department spokesman Patrick Ventrell and Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano.

Obama made his plea to the same members who just two days earlier, during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, told senators that the NSA was not collecting ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans.""

Obama's message, which was posted to Facebook, also came the same day the House voted to renew the Patriot Act without the expiration date that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had planned to allow for. The Senate also voted in favor of extending the act by a vote of 73-23, while the House passed the extension by a vote of 342-87.

"""If we don't have an agreement by Friday, then it becomes very difficult,"" the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, said at the start of the G20 meeting.

Mrs Merkel has made a series of compromises over the course of the year as her partners sought to get a deal. She has offered a further €6.1 billion in aid and €4 billion in extra investment to Ukraine and an increase in the size of a fund set up for Ukraine to repay debts.

Her comments came as Ukraine and the West both appeared to be edging closer to an agreement, after Mr Poroshenko held a telephone conversation with the US president, Donald Trump, who had raised the issue at the G20 meeting in Germany last month.

Mrs Merkel also said the deal would help Ukraine to regain international respect. ""We believe that an agreement reached today in Minsk, as we call it, would allow for an increased influence for Ukraine and would make it possible for it to regain its international respect,"" she said.

""I hope we will be able to sign this agreement at the end of the year, if possible,"" Mrs Merkel added.

She said the talks on Thursday with Mr Poroshenko were ""constructive"". The Ukrainian president had previously"
"MIDI Controller

Introduction

This is the MIDI controller that is being developed by a member of the Audio Hijinks forums, with some input from me and some input from the folks on the forum.

It was designed for a Yamaha VCM-2000, and should work well on any keyboard or MIDI device. I haven't tried it on my computer yet. I don't expect any bugs or compatibility problems, though, as I'm the one doing most of the work on the controller. I have to test the controller out to be sure.

You'll find the full code and schematic for this controller at:

http://www.davidtweeter.net/audio/index.html#controller

The code is currently very simple, with the intention being to make the controller easy to use and useable in a few short steps, but not overly complicated. This should make it possible to write an entire controller, if you like.

There is also an optional feature, that allows for a very high-level MIDI control language. It should work in any MIDI environment, though it should be a little easier to work in an audio environment, since all you'll really have to do is type some commands"

1. The Waking Light, The First Adventure by Ken MacLeod

It's hard to put this into words. When I was younger I always wanted to make games, but it seemed to always be the other way round. It didn't feel right, I thought that making games was for a very small, specialized group. And even then, I felt like the medium was pretty limited. When I first saw Ken MacLeod's The Waking Light, it changed my mind. I started thinking about all of the games that I wanted to make. And what a relief to be able to just do it! This book is so big it feels like you've stepped into another world, where there are no borders to how you make a game. The game world is so expansive, and yet so intimate at the same time. It"
"If you haven't read it, or seen the trailer, this is one of the most talked about movies of the summer, with critics praising director/writer/star, Joss Whedon, for making a very mature film. I was wondering if there was an opportunity to review it in my new column.

There wasn't. However, the movie is absolutely worth seeing, especially for people who enjoyed his television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which I don't have an affiliation with, but was very good.

This is the first movie from Joss Whedon since 2010's The Avengers, but his script for it is almost as good, if not better than what was written for that film. This film has an overall feel to it, that I can see would fit very well with his television show Firefly, but without the drama that Whedon has made such an iconic part of the show. The story of this movie is the story of an alien being called the Watcher.

The movie opens on the Watcher and a small group of other Watchers being led to an unknown planet, and as the group approaches, a bright flash is seen from the horizon.

This flash was later found to be a signal of the impending arrival of an ancient alien"
"A man accused of stealing $8.4 million in gold bullion and platinum from a California jeweler will face a trial in October, nearly three years after he allegedly took it.

Ramon Figueroa was charged last year in San Mateo County, Calif., with a slew of crimes including grand theft of jewelry, money laundering and possession of stolen goods, the Los Angeles Times reported.

But the 41-year-old former truck driver, who had a lengthy rap sheet dating to 2003, never faced a trial after he was ordered held without bail after an alleged prison escape in early 2017.

""We were always hopeful he would be arrested and brought to justice. Unfortunately, this happened at the wrong time,"" David Leinberger, an attorney who represented the jeweler, said.

""There has to be some accountability here.""

The alleged break-out happened when Figueroa and other members of a ""knockout"" gang that was using a tunnel to escape a California jail were able to grab a small amount of gold, silver, platinum and palladium bars worth $8.4 million and a cache of stolen cars, according to authorities.

Prosecutors alleged Figueroa was a part"
"MUMBAI: The Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) today came down heavily on the government for ""ignoring"" its request to extend the deadline to transfer cases of suspected terror links from the central government's National Investigating Agency (NIA) to state security forces.

A BJP delegation, which visited the Mumbai offices of the Maharashtra ATS and the state intelligence agency on Wednesday, demanded an extension in the deadline and for a comprehensive list of the people who were suspected to be linked with the Indian Mujahideen. The delegation, led by senior BJP leader Subhash Deshmukh, also demanded the resignation of the ATS chief.The Maharashtra police, meanwhile, claimed to have no records on suspected terror cases which could help the NIA to decide the next step.

""There are no such records. It's the first time such a delegation from a political party is visiting the Maharashtra ATS,"" an NIA officer told PTI.

A BJP leader said the BJP wanted the NIA to provide details on cases of terror links being probed in Mumbai and Pune, two areas which the party considers as key to its political prospects in the next Lok Sabha polls.

"In the mid-90s, when he was in the top ranks of the sport, the first thing Steve Cook thought of when he was told about a potential opponent was, ""Can he handle it?""

That is an important distinction, because while there are certain elements that define a fighter's style, the real defining characteristic of any fighter's style is the way the fighter handles himself under fire.

At that time, Cook, now an executive at WME-IMG, was working as the top executive for the WEC and its champion, then-champion Royce Gracie.

Cook knew the Gracie family, and they knew him, so when a request was put to Gracie to put his daughter Rener Gracie in a match against his son Nick, Cook knew exactly who she was.

""They said, 'We're putting your daughter in the match,'"" Cook recalls. ""So, I went down there and I had Rener beat Nick with the submission hold in about 10 seconds.""

But what was Cook's reaction to Rener Gracie?

""I remember that I had her win. It was just like a little bit of relief, a little bit of relief that she could beat her"
"A couple of weeks ago we published an article entitled, ""5 Tips to Build an Audience"" (see it here). In it, I discussed my personal strategy to get readers of this blog and readers of other online marketing sites to sign up for my email newsletter and other products I've published on the subject.

Now I wanted to take a more personal approach, so I've compiled the following tips into an infographic, and I'm inviting you to share this with your marketing colleagues and friends!

Here's how it works:

1. Don't Be Too Salesy

I have an email marketing subscription list of over 200,000 people who've downloaded the free ebooks and videos I've made on this blog and elsewhere. I do not send them ""junk mail"". In fact, I do my best to avoid the term ""sales pitch"" (as it sounds!) as it implies you are trying to get your target audience to sign up for something (often an e-mail course) rather than just share content they'll enjoy.

In other words, my advice on email marketing is this: Don't send out any junk mail. I get a lot of ""thank you for sharing this with your friends and family!"""
"A federal judge ruled this week that the federal government may not enforce a controversial anti-transgender policy.

A transgender teen, identified in court papers by her former legal name of Bradley, is suing the federal government over a rule requiring transgender students in public schools to use the restrooms corresponding to the gender with which they were assigned at birth.

In her decision, Judge Reed O'Connor wrote:

The United States, through the Secretary of Education, is entrusted by our nation's Constitution and laws with the responsibility to ensure that all of our students have the educational opportunity necessary for them to succeed. To that end, the Department has a compelling and legitimate interest in ensuring that the gender of the students who attend public school is not an impediment to their educational progress. This case does not present the issue whether all public school students must use the bathrooms corresponding to their gender assigned at birth. This court's mandate in Doe v. Oakton Area School District No. 203 (2007), however, does hold that a public school's nondiscrimination policy prohibiting discrimination against transgender students must also prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender identity, as it has here.

Bradley, a 17-year-old senior at Oakton Area High School, filed her"

"""The decision is not only to suspend the application, but it is a permanent one,"" he said in an email.

He also said the school system will investigate the ""lapses of the past few weeks and make every effort to provide students with an academic program that is safe, respectful and welcoming to all.""

In an email sent to parents Monday night, the school system's president and superintendent said:

""As of today, we will no longer be granting student registration in any class this term,"" according to the email, obtained by CNN affiliate WUSA. ""In order for our students to successfully graduate and pursue higher education, they must be educated and trained.""

In an earlier email to parents, school superintendent John Wilson wrote: ""I am not going to say any more today as to why I made the decision, but I can assure you it has nothing to do with the content of this group's message.""

A separate letter from Wilson to students said, in part, that ""we cannot be in a position where we have students enrolled who cannot succeed.""

In addition, he wrote:

""The reason we have made this decision is to give all our students, who have earned the right to attend, the"
"Bishop says it's'sad' the public is still 'flooded' with sexual abuse claims

Updated

Bishop of Brisbane and Sunshine Coast David Colquhoun says there are ""totally false claims"" and ""absolutely"" no cases of clergy sexual abuse being covered up, after the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse found there had been widespread abuse of children in Catholic schools and institutions.

The Commission made several recommendations in its report on Tuesday, including the creation of a royal commission to investigate cases of clergy abuse that were covered up for years.

Mr Colquhoun said there was ""no cover up"", and it was sad there was still an ""overwhelming flow of allegations and stories of sexual abuse"".

""This is not to suggest that we've had an extraordinary response, or that we haven't made some progress, or that the problem hasn't been taken seriously,"" he told Lateline.

""We have seen, we have heard, the stories, we have been there to meet people, we've listened, we've given evidence and we've listened to the people, but there is a vast flow of allegations and stories and I'm afraid I have to say I'm saddened by"
"""There was no real question about it, they had it. I was just shocked because I knew how big a deal this is for them, but it wasn't the reason we played them.""

A little more than three years ago, when the St. Louis Blues made the controversial trade for then-Hockey Canada star Jordan Leopold from the Western Hockey League's Moose Jaw Warriors, many around the hockey world had never heard of Leopold, much less seen his highlight-reel goal in an exhibition against Team Europe at the 2013 IIHF World Championships.

In that same time frame, Leopold, then a member of Team North America, would make his NHL debut in the Blues' 4-0 loss to the Colorado Avalanche at the start of the 2015-16 season, then score in the final period of that contest in what turned out to be a 1-1 tie against the Buffalo Sabres.

Last week, the Blues reacquired Leopold for a second-round pick, a prospect and a conditional seventh-round selection.

Leopold is back with Team North America this week, but for the second straight exhibition season, the forward was one of the final players sent back to St. Louis as"
"If you've been to an outdoor party and felt like the place got too hot and crowded, this could be the solution for you. A company in Switzerland is using a robot to move the masses around and cool them off. The robots are equipped with air fans and heaters, which allow them to move and change directions. They even come with an ""ice maker"" so people can cool themselves off without getting wet.

The robot was built by Swiss firm Autoliv, which sells industrial robots in Switzerland and China, reports Tech Crunch.

The robot uses a platform and wheels, so it's mobile but can also walk around the area, depending on how many people it has. The robot's creators claim it's a good alternative for party organizers and nightclubs that want to control crowd numbers.

It also sounds like it would work really well as a ""social host"" – an employee or club member who helps customers with food, drinks and other amenities. It could be helpful for anyone who has trouble keeping a party going at times."
"In an interview with The Independent, former Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader says he ""could not find anyone to sign a letter"" opposing Donald Trump.

In a letter that he circulated on Facebook on Sunday, Nader accused the president-elect of ""serious constitutional and ethical issues"" that should be examined by the electoral college, but also noted that ""in my view, he would have won if there had been an honest count in Florida, Wisconsin and Michigan.""

Nader added:

Donald Trump, for instance, won Florida and Wisconsin and Michigan in the electoral college vote. Yet Hillary Clinton received more votes than the electoral votes she received. Why is that? That is one of the questions that we should all be asking, because if the votes had been properly counted in those three states, there was no question that Trump would have lost the electoral college vote to her.

He then concluded by noting: ""If we don't have the vote counts, then we have to have the ballots counted. The ballots need to be verified to ensure that every vote was counted correctly. And if they aren't, then there is no way of knowing if a fraud has taken place. There needs to be an investigation, and it needs to be independent"

"If you were a regular listener to The B.S. Report on Sportsnet, then you probably have seen some of our great stories about the Canucks and the players in Vancouver. We are also very fortunate to be in a great position to bring you an inside look into what the Vancouver Canucks do during the regular season and playoff season, so I decided it was about time to have some fun. I thought about what I could come up with, and it ended up being pretty funny, and pretty hilarious, but not for the wrong reasons.

The following are a series of stories that take place over the course of the regular season. All the stories have some element of the players in them. In some cases, I had some insight into the stories from someone who actually does play the sport, and I asked that person for the story. I tried to put all the stories together so they would fit together into one article, and then I got to writing and editing it, and the story became so long it was getting longer. The goal of this article series is to just make the story better and hopefully, they can help some people learn more about the game.

We also did a segment on Sportsnet's ""Tucker and Callahan"", and I'll"
"If you haven't read it, here's the review I wrote. I do have a couple of other thoughts as well.


In this novel, I've found myself thinking more and more about how my own personal life is reflected in my work and how it all is tied together. It's hard not to be reminded of my own life.


And now, in a novel I was never planning on reading, I feel that it is appropriate that I post a review on it. I'll give you a hint, I'm a very long way into this book and it's all about to get pretty interesting.


I do like a good mystery novel and I'll admit this one was a fun, even enjoyable, read. However, the story was very repetitive and didn't have that'something' that would have made this book a worthy purchase for me. There were too many things going on in this book that were not important enough to take the story from boring to exciting. It wasn't until I hit page 80 that I was given that little 'kick' I've been searching for in any book I read so far. I just wasn't excited. I just wanted to get to the end so that I could finish it and not be frustrated with"
"As we begin the week, here are some highlights from the past week's events and reports.

The most important of which: The Pentagon confirmed on Wednesday that Russia launched its own ballistic missiles into Syria last month. The Pentagon called the move ""unprecedented,"" saying Russia violated a ceasefire and violated U.N. resolutions.

This is an escalation and a clear violation of a ceasefire, as well as of international law and a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions. We urge all countries, particularly the Russian Federation and Syria, to refrain from further military activities that would further destabilize the region, including with the deployment of additional ground-based missiles, and we call upon Russia and the international community to consider increased diplomatic, economic, and humanitarian support to alleviate suffering and provide for humanitarian relief for the Syrian people.

As The New York Times noted in its article on Thursday, ""Russia's intervention in Syria, while it is intended to defend the regime of President Bashar al-Assad against what Moscow believes are terrorist threats, has turned the civil war into an all-out confrontation with the United States.""

In another report on Thursday, Reuters reported that ""President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have been exchanging heated phone calls for almost two months"

"""When a woman goes out in public, it is assumed she is going to be harassed and harassed will happen. So women have a self-perceived need to defend themselves,"" says Shiri Cohen-Rottenberg, author of ""The Invisible War,"" which looks at how the ""gender pay gap"" and the ""pregnancy gap"" have impacted American workplaces. ""They have a need to feel that they're doing the right thing. If they say anything in a conversation that makes other people uncomfortable, it is taken as a challenge to them to prove how 'tough' they are. You know what's going on here? There is a hidden agenda at play.""

She continued, ""We all want to feel that we're in a safe environment and we're protected, and the more that people are uncomfortable around women, the less comfortable they'll feel. There's this culture where women feel like if they're uncomfortable they have to be tough. We have this double standard that has to be dealt with. We've been trained that we are not allowed to feel vulnerable, that we are not allowed to be vulnerable and we can't express vulnerability.""

But for some, this isn't about ""feeling vulnerable"" and ""expressing vulnerability."""
"In a move that could put him on the path to a potential role in the Clinton campaign, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters Monday that he was ""absolutely"" in the running to run the State Department's ""peace corps.""

""I have had many meetings about peace corps in the past, I think about five, and I think I have a very strong feeling about peace corps, because I think that, I think there are certain problems in foreign policy, particularly foreign policy that the country is in, and that is the economy,"" Gingrich told Fox News host Bret Baier. ""If we want to rebuild the country economically and in terms of its foreign policy, I think you can do both very effectively, but the American people will never accept a president who has no foreign policy.""

Gingrich is not a known quantity for foreign policy or American diplomacy. But as the GOP's chief congressional critic and the man who spearheaded the government shutdown of 1995-1996, Gingrich has become something of an expert on how to attack Democrats over budget deficits, domestic spending and other issues.

As Fox News first reported, Gingrich is believed to be mulling a bid to become Clinton's secretary of state if the former first lady decides to run for president. The"
"This article originally appeared in The Huffington Post and was reproduced here with permission.

It's an odd sight.

The morning of March 11, at about 4:15 a.m., the Trump White House received a text message from one of their aides:

""Reince just called,"" it read.

""What is it?"" Trump's senior adviser and chief of staff asked his assistant, who replied:

""The FBI just told [White House Counselor Don McGahn] they have reason to believe that [Trump's national security adviser Michael] Flynn may be susceptible to blackmail by the Russians.""

A few minutes later, McGahn, a seasoned veteran of White House communications who's served for four decades, was called back from a weekend in Palm Springs, Calif., where he'd gone for the wedding of an old college friend. The text from his assistant came from Trump, who'd been tweeting about how Flynn had to go and that Flynn's ouster would be good for the White House's standing in the world.

McGahn had never even seen Flynn's resignation letter. And when he arrived, the first words out of his mouth were: ""Are you sure you want me to do this?""

"In an unprecedented move, a former US vice president has told a newspaper that President Trump is unfit to run the country and that a military coup is the only option left for the nation.

Retired Lt. General William G. Miller told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that the ""military will have to take over,"" a response to Mr. Trump's refusal to say if he would stand by his pledge to defend the country in the face of North Korea's threats.

Mr. Trump's decision to strike Syria last month also left a ""void of American leadership"" that only the military can fill, Mr. Miller told the paper, citing a tweet Mr. Trump posted last weekend: ""The world is watching! Stay strong Syria!""

""We have a commander-in-chief who seems to think it is all about him, and we don't need one,"" said Mr. Miller.

The military takeover would likely involve an uprising, said Mr. Miller.

""In a democracy, it takes time,"" said Mr. Miller. ""There would be an insurgency, and then it would take some time to organize and prepare. But if they have the guts to take power and topple him, then I don't see how the American"
"If you were a parent who has never played an action adventure game, then I am pretty sure you were completely unaware of the classic and legendary Donkey Kong Country. Released in 1998, this is a game that I cannot believe has aged this well, but it is an example of a classic and is something you must play to be reminded of it. It was released on the Super Nintendo and as it is one of the first titles for the system, you may want to take the time to experience it, especially if you grew up playing games like the original NES, or Super Mario 64.

As a kid, I had a special love for this game. I had the SNES at the time, so it was an adventure that was available for it and I had never experienced anything quite like this. You have control of Mario who has to go back and rescue Princess Dixie from her castle by going through different levels. In these levels, you can take on a few different enemies or just collect coins and stars that will make the game harder or easier to complete. In a sense, it was a classic game, and one that was unique to its time and era, and that's the main reason I feel the game should still be played. It is the original adventure"

"MUMBAI: India is unlikely to become a net importer of oil by 2015-16 because the country has the potential to import about 20 million tonnes of oil a year from China by the end of this financial year.China will continue to be a big customer for oil imports in 2015-16 and this year the country is likely to be India's third biggest crude buyer, the Energy Ministry has said.India, the world's third biggest crude consumer after China and the US, imported 4.5 million tonnes of crude and condensate in 2013-14 from the Middle Kingdom and plans to buy at least 15 million tonnes from China by 2015-16, Energy Minister Piyush Goyal said at a recent conference in Mumbai.China has become an increasingly important customer of oil as the world's biggest crude importer has been increasingly pushing up the prices it charges to refiners.""We expect India to become the third biggest crude supplier from China and a key buyer of its condensates by 2015-16. If the situation persists, we can even be the world's third biggest consumer of oil from China,"" he said at a meeting organised by the Energy Research and Information Systems Institute of India, the first such conference held on an institute's campus in over two"
"In the days of old, I remember an episode of the Simpsons, where Bart, one of the family members, has his face ripped off. His eyes are gone, but he still looks like his old self. But how? I couldn't find out. It turns out that the original version of the episode featured an image that looked like the one on this page. The Simpsons image has since been modified and changed in such a way as to not have any of its original features, such as the eye and the eye hole. This page presents a collection of such images from the Simpsons episode ""A Star is Burns"", with explanations about how the image was altered and what it could represent."
"If you haven't been watching the latest episode of Breaking Bad, I recommend you watch it, and if you haven't been following Breaking Bad since the show was cancelled in 2013, I recommend you rewatch it now. I am not a big fan of AMC's drama, and I never had a high opinion of Bryan Cranston as an actor, but when I watch the show, I like how he's playing Walter White. And while the last episode was very dark, I enjoyed it so much I am going to continue rewatching the show in hopes of finding the perfect way to say goodbye to Walter White.

The episode in which Walt turns the tables on Jesse was quite moving, as it reminded us just how much Walt's actions are driven by his desire for the people around him to be happy. Even if he is the only person left standing. Walt has no intention of ever letting the world know what he did. Even when it would kill him, or if the DEA or police or FBI would come to take him down. And his last act in the last scene was to let a stray dog in his front yard out of his control. He wants it to go.

One thing I was never sure of before the show's final episode aired was"
"Mumbai, November 14: The Election Commission (EC) is considering an unprecedented move of taking the name of an Opposition leader's daughter off a list of voters as a show of its goodwill to the party. The move was reported in a local news paper on Friday and if confirmed, would mark an unprecedented act in the history of independent India. The EC is believed to have told the local electoral officer, Sitaram Yechury, that the move could help the BJP's party.

Yechury was appointed on December 11 by EC as a ""temporary officer"" to work out details of polling day. According to a report in The Times of India, he is to report to EC in Delhi on December 29, the date of the national elections, with the final report by December 30.

On Friday, the newspaper had reported that Yechury will report on December 28 and the EC's official spokesman Praveen Pardeshi would say ""if necessary, action would be taken on the basis of his report"". The newspaper had said the move may be taken up for consideration in a meeting on December 31, the day before the results are declared.

The EC had also confirmed that the local officer had received Yechury's report"
"As part of its ""Build A Better Android"" project, Google today released the latest build of its Android Studio IDE, which has now been in open beta since March. Android Studio 0.7.0 includes several important features that the team expects will be the focus of future development of the IDE. The IDE is available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux users and features a ""New Material Design"" user interface, a new build system based on Gradle, and support for Android 8.0 Oreo and its new ART runtime.

As noted, Android Studio is built on a version of IntelliJ Platform that includes the Java plugin that supports the Java 8 language features in the new version of the platform, along with the support libraries. Android Studio also includes support for Android Emulator Tools for Java and Android Debug Bridge, which will make it easier to develop on Android.

As Google announced last month, Android Studio 0.7.0 is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, the first build of the new OS to include the Android 8.0 (Oreo) platform API level, as well as Android Nougat and the new ART runtime. As we've reported previously, the IDE now includes the latest features that were available in"
"""The very idea of being 'dumped' on is one that we all share as a human species and a part of what we are, whether or not we know it. And when that happens to us, it can have profound and life-altering effects on our psyche,"" Dr. Jack Levin, author of ""The Unbearable Weight of the World,"" said in a press release.

""If we had an individual in the modern world that had to experience the kind of pain we've all gone through in our lifetimes, this individual could be easily described as clinically depressed, clinically anxious and even suicidal,"" he said.

"The University of Cincinnati's mascot, Bear Bryant, has died at age 96, university officials said Wednesday.

Bryant died from natural causes Wednesday afternoon at a nursing facility, U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, announced in a news release.

Brown called the former University of Alabama and University of Alabama-Birmingham standout a ""tireless ambassador and ambassador of the university and his legacy.""

The university said Bryant was hospitalized for treatment for a heart problem in August, and he suffered another heart attack in his home earlier this year. He died at 4 p.m. Tuesday, according to a hospital news release.

Bryant's official portrait will hang in the library building honoring the university's 100th anniversary, according to the news release.

In September, Brown, along with Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, co-authored legislation that was dubbed ""The Bill to Rebrand the University of Alabama"" because it would have given U.S. football the name the Crimson Tide.

Bryant led the school from 1940-1967 and became the first African-American football player at an all-black institution, according to U.S"
"This article originally appeared at The Hill and is reprinted here with the author's permission.

As President Barack Obama's presidential legacy nears its end, a few issues are sure to become top-of-mind for historians. One of them will be his signature healthcare law.

For years, critics have decried Obamacare's flaws as too complicated to navigate and a bureaucratic nightmare for ordinary people. The president has called his signature piece of legislation ""the law of the land"" and promised Americans will have more time to adjust.

The Affordable Care Act was designed to extend coverage to a significant number of uninsured Americans through an individual mandate that requires everyone to purchase coverage. In order to pay for this coverage, the government has created tax credits to help individuals pay for private health plans, as well as government subsidies for Medicaid and Medicare.

As many critics have predicted, Obamacare's implementation has been maddeningly inconsistent. The website rollout and other aspects of the healthcare law's launch were plagued with technical difficulties, leaving some Americans waiting in line for days to receive coverage. And after initially offering people coverage for 2014, the administration decided to extend the program through the rest of 2015, in hopes that more people will sign up and boost its finances.

"A new poll conducted by Public Policy Polling (PPP) has found that if a General Election were to be held tomorrow, President Donald Trump's approval rating would hover in the low- to mid-30s.

The poll of 862 likely voters, which has a margin of error of 4 percent, showed Trump at 27 percent, with 44 percent of voters saying they disapprove of the president. The PPP poll has shown that the president has had a historically low approval rating, which peaked in August when his approval was just 27 percent.

In the poll, voters also said they disapproved of his performance so far, with 62 percent saying that the president was not doing a good job in addressing the challenges facing the nation, with 29 percent saying the president was doing a good job.

The president's low approval rating may be linked to his lack of focus on key policy issues. While voters approve of his overall job performance, they disapprove of how he has been handling a variety of key issues including his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, which he claims would cost America ""millions"" in jobs.

Trump also recently signed an executive order aimed at cracking down on immigration from a variety of Muslim countries. However, his"
"Ranking of the world's top 200 most-populated countries, 2015

In a new study of the most-populous countries, the UN ranked the top 20 countries based on the number of people, adjusted for age, in each.

The world's most populated country was, unsurprisingly, China with 2.36 billion people in 2014. The UN's Human Development Index ranks China the world's second most developed country after the United States, and second to the UK. The Chinese are also the world's second-biggest producers of exports and its manufacturing is second to that of the United States. China is the largest country on the list, with an index of 7.97, followed by the UK, Germany, France, Australia and Brazil.

The US came in first in the global rankings with an index of 7.81. The UN notes that the United States ""has become increasingly rich in terms of per capita income since its economic recession, which was not a factor in the index's rankings."" The index shows that the United States, and its northern neighbour Canada, have the most people in the world and have also become the most wealthy country in the world since 1990, although it should be noted that the index uses the Gross Domestic Product"
"In the early 20th century, there were only a few breweries in America, and most were in the New York metropolitan area. Most people who visited the brewery would visit a brewery tasting room and sample beer on site. It wasn't until the 1930's when breweries began to open all over the country. The first American-owned brewery to open was St. Paul's Brewing Company. It opened in St. Paul, Minnesota on December 22, 1931, with two beers – an American Wheat beer, and a dark beer – which became known as St. Paul Amber Ale and Dark Porter. In 1937, the company was purchased by Anheuser-Busch InBev and opened a new brewery, now named The Minnesota Brewery. It opened its doors on October 4, 1935, and its flagship brew, Schlitz Malt Liquor, was brewed from 1937 to 1938.

In 1939, Schlitz Malt Liquor was acquired by Anheuser-Busch InBev. On October 23, 1939, the brewery opened its doors in the town of Minneapolis and opened the doors to its first tap room on the ground floor. Schlitz Malt Liquor was renamed Budweiser in 1947 and has remained that way to the present day. The Minnesota brewery became the"
"We can only imagine what was on the mind of our guest, the great Rufus Wainwright, on the night of the ""Star Spangled Banner"" last April 4th, the 100th anniversary of its adoption. The night, he recalled in an interview with the New York Times, ""was the culmination of my life, for the last several years I had been living on a kind of voluntary resignation."" He was 76 years old and a former professor at Yale and Columbia, the only professor of American literature in either university. In those years, Wainwright had written more than 150 books, mostly about Shakespeare.

In that same interview, he said of his latest novel, The Age of the Barricade:

It's about the birth of modern science and its effects on literature, and its influence on the culture that it created. The great poet William Cowper had an enormously profound influence on science, on philosophy and on politics and society, but in a more personal way. The age of science, and of scientific inquiry in general, had been the era of scientific and mathematical investigation and invention and innovation in all the arts and sciences. And, in some sense, it was the age of literary invention, when all that had to do"
"In the past three weeks, the Department of Defense (DOD) and its Defense Science Board (DSB) have conducted an experiment that shows just how much a major technological shift in warfare has already changed. The two-year experiment is an effort to better understand and assess how a change to the U.S. military's ability to rapidly deploy cyber warfare capabilities, as well as the associated cyber attacks, might influence the course of the wars in the Middle East, the South China Sea, and the cyber realm. The goal of this study is to provide an assessment of the impact on U.S. military strategy of the rapid adoption and use of these technologies in future warfighting scenarios. The DSB conducted a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of cyber warfare, from the technical to the operational aspects, and evaluated all possible ways in which a future U.S. warfighting scenario could be influenced by this new capability.

In a new study, ""A Long-Term Assessment of U.S. Cyber Strategy and Effects of New Cyber Technologies in U.S. Strategy and Warfighting,"" released on Oct. 3 by the DSB, the study concludes that the deployment of these technologies to support cyber warfighting will not have an immediate impact on warfighting capabilities"
"It was only a matter of time before the world got an official Pokemon Go app for its devices, and now that app is available for download on the App Store and Google Play. The Pokemon Go app, available as a free download, has been around for some time and has seen some notable improvements from time to time, including the introduction of augmented reality, new ways for users to battle with the Pokemon Go smartphone game, and a more streamlined approach for the app to better accommodate a wider array of devices. The new app has the ability to handle any type of Android device that can connect to a phone or tablet and play Pokemon Go.

As of today, Pokemon Go for Android devices can be downloaded on Google Play or Apple's App Store for free, with no ads or in-app purchases, although a paid version will be available for $9.99, $2 more than the free version. It also has an ""Early Adopter"" deal for those who want to receive an email from the app before it is made available to everyone else, so those who don't want to spend any money can still play Pokemon Go on Android devices without the fear of having to pay.

It is not immediately clear whether this is an official app release from Pokemon or"
"If you've never tried an all-grain batch before, this is your chance! All you need is some grains (like oats or rice) and some water to brew it! You don't need any special equipment, either, you just need some room and some time!

Let's start by heating some water in a small saucepan and pouring it into your kettle. The idea is to have all of the grains soak in the hot water for a couple minutes and then get turned to a very fine, high-gluten flour (this is the purpose of a large, deep saucepan, or colander). The water and grains should be hot before you begin, and they'll take longer to get the water and grains heated up in the water bath if you put it in the microwave first.

Once your water is hot, put all of the grains into the pot (with the grains separated into the layers).

Stir everything up, then take out your colander (which should already have been lined with a very large piece of parchment paper to catch the steam) and carefully strain out any big pieces of flour that were left. This is called ricing. You should be able to see a big glob of flour at the top of the"
"""The Trump campaign had an elaborate conspiracy to hide its connection to the Russian government, with the president and his closest advisors conspiring to defraud the U.S. public, mislead the country's foreign adversaries, and potentially obstruct justice,"" the Senate Judiciary Committee announced Wednesday, releasing a memo it had prepared. The committee, in a letter to Comey, also said that Trump was a ""person of interest"" in the FBI investigation, which it has said was begun after Comey's dismissal in May.

Trump has been repeatedly called to testify under oath about his dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. And in July, Comey reportedly requested the appointment of a special counsel to lead the FBI's probe. But in a letter sent Tuesday, Comey wrote that the White House has now requested he remain in office to answer questions about Trump, a move he said was ""highly inappropriate and unprecedented.""

Comey, who was appointed as FBI director by Barack Obama, was leading a probe into Trump's alleged ties with Russia before he was fired in early May, but that probe is said to have been hamstrung by his dismissal.

Comey has said he believes the White House interfered with the probe in an attempt to prevent it from uncovering ties between the president's aides"

"The International Energy Agency's (IEA's) report on world oil demand and supply estimates that in 2016, there will be a rise in consumption of about 0.7 million barrels per day. In this post, I discuss what these results mean in terms of oil production, consumption and global economic activity.

In short, oil consumption is expected to grow at a moderate rate over the coming years. As I mentioned above, global consumption in 2016 will rise from the level in 2015 of about 90.1 million barrels per day, to 94.7 million barrels per day, but at a slower pace of growth (1.0 percent annually). This slower pace of growth is expected to last until 2040, when oil consumption is expected to peak.

Consumption growth will slow to an annual average rate of 1.6 percent through 2020 and to an annual average of 0.4 percent thereafter, before rebounding slightly to a growth rate of 2.3 percent per year in 2030, 3.1 percent in 2040, and 3.9 percent per year thereafter. This slowdown will not result in any substantial impact on oil consumption levels.

Production of oil is also expected to increase modestly to 87.2 million barrels per day in 2016 and will"

"Baroness Warsi said in her maiden speech as Conservative party leader that ""the Labour party should not have an 'allies' problem."" She has made that point a few times now. It is a fair point. If Labour were a right-wing party, it might be considered a ""ally."" But as the leader of the biggest party, the government of the day is Labour and that has made Labour an important part of government, too. The fact that a right-winger is not ""allies"" with a right-winger, that is the point.

It is a point that Lord Kinnock, Labour leader from 1983-1988, made in the 1970s.

That is why there has been an interesting debate in Labour about whether, given the choice between ""allies"" and ""opponents"", the right of the party should go to the left of the government on most issues, including Europe.

In an article last week in the Observer, Jonathan Ashworth, shadow Cabinet Office minister, argued that ""a new Conservative government, which will govern for a minimum of three years, must be willing to work with Labour. Otherwise it risks having its whole agenda overturned. In short, we can't allow a rightward"

"As an advocate for a strong defense and national security, I believe we should not only take the appropriate action against our enemies, we must do everything possible to prevent future terrorist attacks on this nation and our allies. We cannot do both, and our security depends on our ability to prevent terrorists from even being able to think of launching an attack.

I will do everything in my power to make sure the people of our nation and the world have confidence that our country will meet that challenge.

The question we must ask is, who are the terrorists, and what are the measures that can best defend ourselves and our friends and allies from these terrorist groups?

This week's attacks are another reminder of the threats facing us. The terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., are another reminder of how important it is that the President and Congress work together to defeat this threat.

As President, I have already taken a series of steps to strengthen our national security and to prevent terrorism in our country.

As I mentioned this week, my administration has worked to enhance our homeland security and to protect the American people. Since I have been President, I have ordered more than 1,200 federal officers and agents into the field,"

In the edited video, the woman, identified by the station as 20-year-old Ronda Smith, appears to be knocked unconscious by an oncoming car before being tossed off the overpass.

Smith was eventually taken to the hospital, but died shortly thereafter, police said.

The post on Facebook, which included the video, had received nearly 5,000 shares by Friday evening, WKYT said.

In the original video, a white SUV is seen passing on the left-hand side, and another car appears to pass it on the right, while other vehicles drive up to pass them.

A white truck can then be seen in the video speeding up, and as it gets close to the oncoming car, the driver gets out and gets out of the car, too,"

The game she picked, Dota 2, is the first ever competitive video game in India to be officially approved by Valve, a popular gaming company. The company also announced a $100 million prize pool for this year's The International, the biggest annual international competitive gaming competition.

In India, Dota 2 has a special place in the hearts of many young Indians who can be seen streaming and playing the game on the Internet.

It was only a matter of time until we had the next big-screen incarnation of Batman's most famous villain: The Joker. With Ben Affleck returning to play the caped crusader and The Dark Knight Rises' David Goyer penning the screenplay, we should be getting the latest big screen version of The Joker by the end of the summer. However, the director is in a bit of a bind as the character's current comics storyline is only about to be retconned out of existence, which could potentially ruin Affleck's Joker plans.

To help Batman News readers catch up on everything we've covered about the current Joker, I've created an easy-to-digest timeline to show the main events in the Batman comic book story so far:

Joker was introduced as an inmate at Arkham Asylum by The Joker and his gang of thugs. He quickly gained the respect and admiration of the Joker clan due to his intellect and ruthless approach to his work, and began working for them as their criminal mastermind.

"If you've got a shiny new Android smartphone, and it's in the form of the latest Galaxy S phone, chances are it will be the first one to get a new Android security patch. Samsung is scheduled to push out the update tomorrow.

As Android has gotten increasingly more complex over the past year, and the Galaxy S has grown in popularity, more and more smartphones have come out with built-in security patches. While most phones come out with an Android security update once or twice a year, there are a handful that have been patched several times a year, including Samsung's own Galaxy S phone.

It's unclear exactly what this new Galaxy S security patch does. The Galaxy S and S III have gotten new versions of Android since last year, so the update could just be for that newer phone. Samsung is also getting rid of some old bugs from earlier Android versions.

The company is not disclosing exactly how the new patch works. Samsung said the security update is part of its efforts to protect Samsung Galaxy devices and other Samsung devices, including Android-powered televisions, mobile phones, tablets and laptops."

"In a landmark ruling on Monday, a court of appeals in Germany rejected a government appeal against the release of documents about a German-Israeli arms deal that went sour.

The court rejected a request for a temporary injunction, as it had initially hoped, against a publication ban that would prevent Der Spiegel magazine from reporting about the affair. The newspaper is also facing an appeal to Germany's top constitutional court, the Federal Constitutional Court.

Der Spiegel first revealed in 2012 that Germany and Israel signed an agreement to supply Germany's army with German-made assault rifles and grenades, and a special version of the Heckler & Koch assault rifle that had been manufactured in Israel.

The arms deal had been brokenred by a private equity group led by an Israeli-born businessman named Efraim ""Ephraim"" Stern. The group's shareholding, however, had not been publicly revealed at the time of the deal, which was worth an estimated €2 billion, or $2.1 billion.

"In a bizarre scene that could not have been scripted better, a young man dressed up in a black cape, mask, and red suit and wearing a sword on his hip was spotted roaming around the city's downtown on Thursday night, carrying a sword, and wielding a bat.

According to police, the masked man was carrying a large black duffel bag that contained several items that appeared to be a weapon. The bag, police said, was reported stolen out of the city in late October from an apartment in the 3600 block of West Van Buren.

The man was seen by at least three officers near the intersection of State Street and Broadway and was questioned by police. When he did not identify himself to police, he was then seen running into a nearby park with the large duffel bag and walking toward an apartment building.

While in the park, he was reportedly seen swinging his bat, but officers quickly got there to detain him and return the sword to the man's hand, police said. The bat was then handed back to the man as officers went back to investigate the report of stolen weapons.

The man was seen on video surveillance, and a search was made on Thursday night by the police bomb squad for the sword."
"It was the same with the last two Super Bowl winners, as well: A dominant offense that kept defenses honest, and a dominant defense that allowed them to do what they wanted. The defense did it without blitzes or coverages. They did it by making a couple of key adjustments to how they play defense, and they did it against one of the NFL's most dangerous offenses.

That's exactly how the Giants did it, with an excellent second-half performance that was made even better by a secondary that looked much better in the second half.

It starts with a secondary that looks much better in the second half than in the first. They held the 49ers to only 18 first-half yards on offense, and were a little stingy on defense against San Francisco's high-octane offense.

That's important, because if you can hold a team to under 18 first-half yards, and only give up 20 total, then that team is not going to get the ball back in time for the game to change the outcome of the game. That's what happened in last year's game between these teams: San Francisco only gained six first-half yards, but was still able to tie the game in the final two minutes, and"

(Spoiler: There is some good stuff here.) This time we have 50 TV shows that aired over 50 days of the year and didn't end on a whimper.

To find out where these 50 episodes ended up, we took the total episodes for all of them and divided by 52, to find out what day of the week the show aired. If they were a full week of TV, the days that followed the last episode were the weeks following that episode. (If there were only three episodes, that was the first, second, third, etc.) We've listed all episodes that aired during the 50th day, along with their premiere date and their final date, to find the best ones for your viewing pleasure.

For some shows, there is not enough time in the year to properly build up the seasons to be sure to hit the right points in each episode, and sometimes a single episode could do that for us. The season finales on The X-Files and Lost, for instance, are great. For others, the episodes"

"A woman has been found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and causing grievous bodily harm with intent by intentionally striking an Air India executive.

Jagdish Jha was convicted by the Supreme Court in the Delhi high court, after she admitted to punching and slapping an executive flight attendant and assaulting a steward.

Jha was in her late 50s, and the executive she targeted had a history of alcoholism, and was travelling on an Air India flight.

Jha, who is originally from Kolkata, India, admitted she was ""unhappy"" with the behaviour of the flight attendant and the steward and felt her life would be threatened by her anger.

The jury also heard Jha told police the steward and the executive ""could die from her rage.""

In evidence, she said: ""I wanted to punch them. I was going to hit them, I wanted to hurt them. I didn't think I was going to do that but I felt my life would be threatened by my anger.

"It's easy to see how a number of young adults in their mid-twenties — especially those with families — are tempted to drink alcohol in the hours and days before going on vacation. And it's a bit of a surprise how many are getting drunk or even getting sick from drinking it.

This is an age when the brain is still developing and it can take some getting used to. Some people feel good for the first few days but the effects of drinking can build up and they might find themselves waking up the next day feeling worse.

What can be done about it?

You don't want to make anyone sick — it's bad enough to wake up sick — but there's another more insidious risk when drinking is your habit: getting a hangover.

If you don't want a hangover, stop drinking as soon as possible after you're gone. Don't worry about how long you're gone for or how much alcohol you're drinking; if it's been more than 24 hours and you're feeling better, keep drinking.

The worst time for a hangover is before you leave, because the effects can take several hours to kick in and can cause vomiting and other problems. You might think you'll feel better the"
"The University of Georgia has received its first ""win"" of the new NCAA College Football Playoff era.

Georgia (4-2, 3-0 SEC) earned an easy 24-20 win at Vanderbilt (4-1, 2-1 SEC) Saturday to gain its first win against the Commodores since 2002. It also improved its conference record to 7-2, one game behind the Bulldogs' SEC West opponents.

""They played hard. They came out and gave a great effort and they beat a good team. The thing about Vanderbilt, we know what we're getting,"" said head coach Kirby Smart, whose Bulldogs were the first to beat a SEC West foe. ""We've had our share of struggles, we know that, and they are a team that plays hard.""

The Bulldogs moved into second in the SEC East after taking a 14-10 lead into halftime, thanks to an 84-yard punt return by linebacker Chris Black.

""It's good to get the first win of the season against a great football team,"" Smart said.

The win was the Bulldogs' seventh in their past eight games, including the past six against teams ranked in the Top 10 of the Associated Press Poll. The only loss this season"
"""A little less than half the state's counties, including some that are historically Republican, have no sheriff and just eight percent of all of the county sheriff's positions are vacant, with another nine percent either not filled or held by one of their top lieutenants.""

–Amber A'Lee Frost, Washington Post

In this exclusive video for Truthout, Sheriff Mike Yoder, of Lee County in the American South, tells of a campaign for county sheriffs in which he ran and won against three more Republicans and a Democrat in his district, despite a Democratic Party that he said is ""completely and utterly corrupt"" and an election board that ""seemed to have a blind eye.""

In fact, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the right-wing corporate-backed ""bill mill"" that pushes right-wing legislation in state after state, has pushed state laws in a way that would prevent Yoder, who has run in a number of GOP primaries against more liberal Republicans, from being reelected as sheriff.

The video, produced by The Progressive, features an interview with Yoder about ALEC and the role that it is playing in his state of South Dakota, a state where Republican governor Dennis Daugaard and many"
"The Washington Nationals have had the worst record in the NL since the end of May, and a lot of their problems have come in one-run games. In fact, since May 7, Washington has played in one game that was decided by just one run: the Nationals' Game 6 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 6 of the NLCS. That one run game has come to define a lot of their season, and the Washington bullpen has been one of their biggest problems in that time.

In their past 23 one-run games, the Washington Nationals relievers have combined to allow 11 runs in 13 innings, or a collective 2.29 ERA. That's a big difference from their 0.30 ERA over the entire season. The Washington Nationals' bullpen has been one of the most overmatched units in baseball this year.

So what is the Washington Nationals' biggest problem when it comes to pitching? Well, one thing they're struggling with more than anything else is their inability to finish out a game. In their past 23 one-run games, Washington has a collective 13.44 ERA. They have been one of the worst teams in the game over that span.

Here are their pitching numbers in those 23 games:

"The first day of the trial was set for April 13. A lawyer representing the plaintiffs said the trial would begin April 23. The city said it was planning to open its own trial in June.

In court on Tuesday, defense lawyers were in an angry mood, accusing the plaintiffs of lying in their complaint that the police were improperly using the power of eminent domain to acquire private property to build a public park. They accused the city of trying to force the case out of the city.

Mr. DeMaria and others on the plaintiffs' side were in an angry mood as they listened to their arguments and left the courtroom after the jury returned the verdict.

In her verdict, Judge Cogan said she believed the city had committed an ""egregious misuse"" of eminent domain power in taking the property for a park, and she awarded the plaintiffs $6 million.

Judge Cogan, in an order, also ordered that the city must return the land to the owners of the properties. The city's attorneys were ordered to pay the plaintiffs $6.3 million. The judge did not specify what they were ordered to pay.

"In a bid to promote his upcoming film The Man With the Iron Fists, martial arts legend Jackie Chan has gone on the defensive to claim that his film will be an accurate representation of martial arts in the real world.

""This movie is based on actual facts of how it's used by real people in real world,"" he told The Times of London in a new interview. ""We had real Chinese people in the studio with us, so that was real.""

Chan, whose movie will star actor and martial artist Andy Lau in a role he played in The Man with the Iron Fists, explained that Lau and the other martial arts actors used to practice a martial art called Kukkiwon which is very different from the kind of style depicted in his new movie.

""People used to fight using karate or kung fu,"" said Chan. ""It's more like kung fu, more like real fight, where people would get up on their knees. Kung fu is about getting up and fighting back, using the arms.""

"Bathroom renovations at the White House are over-budget by a ""fraction of the cost"" promised to taxpayers, a Senate report concludes.

A $60 million contract with contractor Turner Construction Co. is still unpaid, as well as an $18.2 million construction budget, the Government Accountability Office report found. The Senate report says the ""unfortunate circumstances"" of the White House renovations have prevented the federal government from tracking down the actual costs to taxpayers.

""This has led to significant misreporting by federal agencies that is preventing the Government from knowing exactly how much taxpayer dollars are being spent to repair or refurbish White House facilities,"" the GAO said in the report released Thursday. ""It also means that the White House has been left with an incomplete picture of how much taxpayer funds it has spent to make improvements at its buildings.""

The GAO said it's still uncertain how much of the construction budget has been paid off or will be paid off. Turner Construction officials have told Congress they're not certain about the contract because they can't access the contracts they've already awarded.

""In all the instances we examined, we found the contract with Turner Construction was paid within the contracted timeframe, but we could not determine the cost"

She bit her lip, biting her lip even more when the man smiled.

She sighed and looked down. She wanted to tell the man to leave, but her lips wouldn't move. Her lips would just say ""yes"" or ""no"", no matter how much she wanted to tell him ""No"". She knew it was his fault. The man's words and his smile were sending her a message.

He leaned his shoulder forward.

"In the days following the deadly Boston Marathon bombings, we asked the New England region's top investigative reporters what they're investigating, how they're doing it and whether there is a conflict between their work and law enforcement's. Here are some of the best responses.

This article was reported in partnership with The New York Times, with the editorial oversight of the newsroom's investigative reporting unit.

""There are no suspects.""

By Scott Dance and James B. Stewart

Scott Dance, investigative reporter and director of the Franklin County Bureau of Investigative Journalism at the Franklin County Sheriff's Office. He's been on the trail of a former Franklin County high school student charged in a Boston Marathon bombing.

There is no ""suspect,"" only ""suspect No. 2,"" as investigators put it.

He was in a car that was seen in the immediate vicinity of the two bombs. The vehicle was stopped by the police for speeding and he was asked for identification.

Investigators are searching the vehicle but are not looking for him. He has been questioned and is in police custody. He was released, according to a law enforcement official.

"It is hard to overstate just how big and impressive a week it was for the Seahawks offense. Seattle beat the 49ers at home in the regular season, the Colts in a preseason game and they went to Seattle for a Monday night showdown against a very good Arizona Cardinals defense. All of this in a span of less than two weeks.

While it was impressive to see the offense bounce back and get going on Monday night against the 49ers, there is one game left on the schedule before Seattle has to take on the Arizona Cardinals on October 22. This game has a big playoff impact for both teams and for Seattle fans who are excited about this playoff push, the only way they can truly experience that is if the offense comes through on a consistent basis and gets back on track against Arizona.

With that in mind, it is important to look back and see just what went right in that week's game. I think that the first thing to take note of is how quickly Seattle was able to turn the page. There was no ""Let's see what they did this week, and see what they do next week."" This was just a matter of letting it go, moving forward, and moving to the next game. It's a mindset that Pete Carroll is"
"""He was always an emotional kid,"" said his mother, Sarah, of the 6-foot-10 forward who went to a prestigious prep school. ""He had this incredible will to do well in life.""

Kreider played at the University of Massachusetts and played professionally with the Boston Bruins from 2013-15 before signing as a free agent with the New York Rangers in 2016.

In addition to playing on the team that won the Stanley Cup in 2013, Kreider was an All-Star last season and has two goals and four assists in three NHL playoff games.

The Rangers drafted him No. 62 overall, ahead of players such as Patrick Kane and Johnny Gaudreau. He will turn 23 this season.

The Rangers, who are playing the Winnipeg Jets tonight, lost forward Kevin Hayes, who suffered a season-ending Achilles injury last Tuesday against the Tampa Bay Lightning, in a trade with the Washington Capitals.

Injuries are not unusual for young players, but it is uncommon for an elite prospect to get hurt so quickly, as Kreider did. He suffered an upper body injury in the third period of the Rangers' 5-0 loss to the Calgary Flames on Oct. 17 and had surgery in Montreal two days later."
"We all know that it takes time and hard work to get good at any sport. For those who do it with their kids, there's even a term for the practice: ""training"". And to a certain degree, parents are to blame.

A study recently released in the Journal of Applied Pediatrics finds that ""children with older fathers were significantly less likely to compete in a competitive sport (e.g., football or soccer) compared with their younger siblings and parents of younger siblings"" (i.e., children of older fathers have been ""trained to not compete"") — the first time researchers have identified a ""training-based"" explanation for lower sports participation by children with fathers over 35.

""It was a surprising result,"" said Dr. Joanna Panksepp, lead author of the study. ""We found a clear relationship between older fathers and sports participation by children but had not seen this relationship before.""

Dr. Panksepp, an assistant professor in the University of Rochester School of Public Health and an expert on gender-related health issues, analyzed data on the children's sports participation from the National Longitudinal Sports Study, which tracks children from birth to the end of eighth grade.

The researchers examined a group of"

It's called the ""flesh-eating bacteria"" (FEC) infestation that is decimating the region's local poultry population, the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reported.

Fecal coliform (Fec) concentrations have reached up to 600 million per liter (L) and more than 200 million per liter are found in the faeces of poultry and pig faeces.

This is the third time the EU's highest scientific body has reported high levels of Feccoli, the species most likely responsible for the outbreaks, according to a report issued this month.

""In addition to the direct human health threat from this bacterial outbreak, the long term implications of this disease and the effects of the environmental and social factors associated with the outbreak, must also be addressed,"" said the OIE.

Infections caused by the disease can cause bloody diarrhea and stomach cramps in people, with the infection becoming resistant to antibiotics and sometimes developing resistance to vaccines as well.

"It was only a matter of time.

As the New York Post reported, Donald Trump, Jr., met with Russian attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya during the 2016 campaign in an attempt to receive damaging information on Hillary Clinton, his father's likely Democratic opponent, and possibly gain incriminating evidence against the candidate herself.

This was hardly an accidental meeting.

As a Republican who has made the defense of his father a cornerstone of his presidential campaign, it was clear from the beginning that Donald Trump, Jr., would be involved. But for most of his father's adult life, Donald Jr., the eldest son of Donald Trump, Jr., had been an advocate for the defense of his father and against the allegations that have come to dominate his father's public image.

During his early 20s, he wrote a series of columns for the New York Daily News in which he attacked Hillary Clinton. As early as 1995, when the elder Trump was considering a presidential run, Donald Jr. had been critical of his father.

""It is my right to have my opinions. And if someone wants to be a Nazi and wants to come to the event, that's fine, and we don't need to ban that. I mean, they are free to attend the event, and if they don't like it, that's fine,"" Alchin told Fox News' Neil Cavuto on Monday. ""We don't have a problem with people's views on anything.""

He said his main problem was the way that he had been treated.

"The International Energy Agency is projecting a further 10-fold rise in the amount of fossil-fuel reserves that need to be kept in the ground if the world is to stay below a 2-degree Celsius temperature rise.

In an update to its ""business as usual"" scenario published Monday, the agency projects the total carbon footprint for energy sources will reach 38.3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide by the middle of the century, up from 6 billion tonnes now. That will rise to 120 billion tonnes of CO2 if all existing reserves were burned, up from 3 billion tonnes today.

The IEA's baseline scenario is based on ""business as usual"" in the year 2100, meaning that there's no significant policy intervention and no immediate action on reducing emissions. In that scenario, emissions peak by 2025 at 32.8 billion tonnes, decline gradually until 2030 when they're expected to hit 23.6 billion tonnes and then level off again after 2050.

But the agency is also forecasting the potential of the oil, coal, and gas industries to develop further to meet demand through the second half of this century. If the IEA is right about this, that will have a significant effect on global greenhouse gas emissions, says the report.

"The Los Angeles Chargers have hired a former player as their offensive coordinator, the team announced Saturday.

Todd Downing, a former Denver Broncos and Cincinnati Bengals quarterback who spent seven years in the league, was named the Chargers' new play caller. The team announced the move during an emotional news conference Friday at their new home in Carson.

Downing has coached quarterbacks with the San Francisco 49ers and Buffalo Bills. He previously was the offensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens and Arizona Cardinals, the teams he spent most of his career with.

He coached under Andy Reid and Greg Roman, two of the best coaches in NFL history, and helped the Cardinals win the NFC West title in each of the past two seasons.

Downing joins an offense that ranked 32nd in the NFL in 2015, its lowest finish in five years. Quarterback Philip Rivers led the league with an 89.3 rating. The Chargers finished 31st in yards and 28th in scoring, though the defense had the best DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average).

Downing was a sixth-round pick of the San Francisco 49ers in 1995 out of Kansas.

In 2011, Downing led the Broncos to an AFC Championship game appearance, losing in the divisional"

"A lot of the talk this year about the state of the presidential campaign has centered around how much it will hurt or help Donald Trump in November. And as many people who watched the GOP debate this week have discovered, the damage that can be done by one word — and the lack thereof — is magnified.

Trump was asked at the debate whether he had ever actually asked for a job or had received a job from the federal government. He did not, of course, and that fact was immediately mocked and seized upon as an example of the lack of authenticity in the real estate magnate.

""I don't need to change anything. I have great people,"" Trump said, with the implication being that he didn't need the job and it wouldn't matter if he did. ""I don't need your endorsement. I'm actually leading by so much among Democrats and independents, I'm leading by such a lot,"" he said, implying he would be even better on the economy than he is in polls.

But what did the moderator really say to him? The only answer we've had from her has been, ""That is an amazing statement,"" so the moderator might as well have just asked the candidate, ""Are you going to let us know"
"""What about the little old ladies and the kids, don't they have a right to see it too? It's not a kid's show! They don't get to see the first 15 minutes and the second 15 minutes.""

It's true that the children do not get to see the first 15 minutes of The Wizard of Oz and the second 15 minutes of Pinocchio, and I can see why a child might ask for it.

However, when the same argument was made for the inclusion of ""The Lion King"" on the DVD, there were complaints from the Lion King fan club because, for one thing, it is an adult film with adults, not children, and for another thing, the first 15 minutes are a prelude to a prequel about the events of the movie, and they had already been released in other places as part of the ""The Lion King"" soundtrack.

That was before I realized that the reason the kids were not getting the first 15 minutes of ""The Lion King"" is because there were children in the audience watching it. And the reason why they didn't get it, when they did, was that the DVD had been re-issued in theaters, and it was in that re-issue that they"
"MARKETING AND MARKETING CONTESTS


Marketing & marketing contests are great ways for your business to show your products or services to potential clients, prospects or customers. These contests are the best way for your company to find out if a person or business is interested in your products and services, and how much they like it.

In some cases, the contests are only open to companies, such as manufacturers or businesses that have been awarded a special award from a company that you would like to get the customer feedback for. Other contests may only be open to employees or contractors of a particular business or business-related organizations.


It's also important to note that while there may be several ways in which you can get involved with marketing contests, the one that you choose to pursue can have an enormous impact on how successful your company can be.


Many companies set up their own contest or promotion with their own criteria as to how to win a prize. They also encourage people to send their contest information and photos to their contest's contact email. These contest sites can help you make your business appear as one with an outstanding reputation, which will give your company the edge that it needs to get the best possible outcome.

"In a rare move, the Justice Department said Thursday that it will not sue the state of California to enforce Proposition 8. The state will lose its right to collect taxes and fees from gay couples that married in the three days after the court decision, but gay couples in other states will remain entitled to federal benefits, like Social Security benefits.

The decision by the federal government does not end a legal battle over gay marriage that has played out since the high court in June ruled that state laws barring gay marriage are unconstitutional. It also means that same-sex marriage is legal in the nine states, including California, where it is banned by law.

""The United States government has long recognized the constitutional right to marry and is thus bound by the decisions of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Windsor, and in United States v. Windsor, United States v. Ireland and United States v. Windsor, that concluded that state bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional,"" Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. wrote in the memo to all federal agencies. ""Today, however, the Department of Justice takes an important step in recognizing that right.""

Kendrick Lamar was just back from his second North American tour. On stage in the heart of Chicago, the Compton native shared that his ""list"" is already getting longer as the tour continues. ""It's so funny,"" he said during his show, which was a collaboration with his label boss and business partner Jimmy Iovine.

The album he was touring on — Damn., out Tuesday, Aug. 5, on TDE — was one of the most hotly anticipated rap debuts this summer.

Kendrick's music is as raw, soulful and intense as anything else on the air. The rapper spoke of his childhood in the West Los Angeles area, where he grew up with an ""insatiable need for love,"" as his mother's first words to him were: ""I don't love you no more, baby, but I love you.""

He recalled being forced to leave a South Central Los Angeles public housing project to attend the private"
"In a press conference today, a police spokesperson told reporters that a man has died after he was shot by officers responding to a 911 call of a suspicious person in an alley near the intersection of N. High Street and North Central Park Drive.

Police say officers arrived at the scene on foot about 3 a.m. after receiving the call, but it took about an hour before officers in the alley began firing, and one officer suffered an injury during the shooting. The man, whose identity is still unknown, later died from his injuries.

Police are currently interviewing the man's relatives, but say the case will be referred to the Milwaukee County district attorney for review. The man has been identified by his last name, Venerable, according to his relatives.

This is the third fatal police shooting in Milwaukee in just under a week. On Sept. 4, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn ordered officers to wear body cameras following a series of high-profile officer-involved shootings.

The Milwaukee Police Association is urging its members to ""never surrender their firearm,"" as they have ""a responsibility to use the very same weapons they have trained and equipped with"" during encounters with citizens, and to use the camera whenever possible.

In addition to Mr. Hiller and the five women who testified in Mr. Hiller's trial, three others — all women who worked for him or lived near him in the West End — gave sworn statements and a fourth — who worked for a firm he owned — was a co-worker, and another woman said that she was Mr. Hiller's mistress, Ms. DeJesus's sister.

The police officers testified about their encounters with Mr. Hiller and Ms. DeJesus, but also about other allegations that Mr. Hiller had made, such as that he was involved in prostitution or that he had had sexual encounters with the five women who testified against him in court.

In closing arguments, Assistant District Attorney Thomas P. DiCesare Jr., said Mr. Hiller's statements and behavior in the months leading up to"

"In a major move to remove a loophole allowing corporations to evade tax on offshore profits, the U.S. government today unveiled a proposal that will require large U.S.-based companies to report to the government the total income of all subsidiaries that are controlled by the corporation.

The Treasury Department has said it will enforce this requirement, and a final decision has not yet been made by President Obama or the Treasury Department on how much this measure would raise, according to Reuters.

The announcement came amid growing concerns among U.S. lawmakers over the role that multinational companies like Apple have played in the U.S. government's ability to collect tax.

In 2011, the company's overseas subsidiaries had a tax rate of 0.005% on $74 billion of profit, according to an investigation by Reuters. This rate was only reduced to 0.008% in 2012 and 2013.

""It is simply unfair to ask our companies to pay more in taxes just because they have made some money abroad,"" the President said.

""Companies like Apple must be willing to pay their fair share of taxes in the countries where they operate, but we're also going to make it easier for U.S. businesses to bring money back into the U"
"The Federal Trade Commission on Monday said it will not be investigating Apple for misleading customers about its pricing. The company said it is committed to giving consumers accurate pricing on Apple's products.

In a blog post on Monday, the company said that while the FTC investigation will continue, Apple's agreement to refrain from ""misleading consumers in order to compete with other manufacturers is the final resolution.""

Apple is facing two separate class-action lawsuits over its pricing on iPhones and iPads. A federal jury found last month that the company had illegally forced customers to buy a more expensive model when they could have got a lower-cost iPhone through its website or at its retail stores. Apple appealed, and a decision is expected in June.

In response, the FTC last week sent letters to several Apple customers who bought a higher-priced model of the iPhone 6 Plus in 2012 than they had paid for elsewhere. In addition, Apple's contract with third-party sellers in the Apple Store app will require them to charge a customer an additional fee for the iPhone if they wish to have it replaced by Apple.

Apple had initially denied the FTC's claims but had then said that it was ""unlikely that it could recover its costs in any such action,"" because its prices"

"As many as 700,000 people across the US will have to leave their homes because of Hurricane Matthew, according to a new study.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the number of homes likely affected by the storm has reached nearly 1.8m since the storm made landfall last week in the state of North Carolina.

""In total, at least 695,000 people are potentially affected by Matthew in the U.S.,"" the agency said.

It said the storm has killed at least 24 people.

In a statement on Tuesday, the agency said that the storm has so far killed nine people in Haiti.

In addition to Florida and the Carolinas, Matthew has already been blamed for a series of deaths and flooding in Haiti's south.

We'll start with him on what the book is and why he and the team are passionate about the project. Then, he and the team will be answering questions and discussing their plans for the coming year.

So, where do you begin with the subject matter of your game?

There's no wrong way to do this. You have to know who your players are, who their characters are, what they are facing in the game world. It's about being able to talk to them about what you're doing and why, and the right way to do this is with your own words, or the words of others. It's like having an open-ended discussion, because if you don't, then it becomes very difficult for people to follow your game, to be involved and engaged.

"In this week's edition of the LPGA Newsletter, we share an updated ranking of the top ten male golfers of 2017 by Golfweek Magazine. The list was compiled by ranking the top 20 players by each major championship they've won (i.e. Masters, PGA Championship, etc). We've included the Golfweek list at the top of the article for a complete view of each golfer.

In our exclusive ranking of the top 20 golfers of 2017, Rory McIlroy holds the #2 spot after winning the PGA Championship this week. Tiger Woods has dropped from the #2 spot he held the last couple years due to a string of bad results including an embarrassing defeat at the Players Championship last week.

The biggest loser on this week's LPGA list was Bubba Watson, who is now #8, despite his historic victory in the Masters and the #1 ranking on Golfweek's 2017 Top 10 list. Watson is one of only two players in history to win the Masters three times in a row and only the second man ever to win the tournament four times (Tiger Woods, 3rd).

"In a press release on Wednesday, the White House announced it has ""identified new opportunities for cooperation"" with Mexico over immigration enforcement and other matters, including an upcoming meeting with the Mexican government in March to discuss the topic.

""As a sign of good faith and as an indication of our willingness to address this matter constructively,"" the release states, ""the U.S. is prepared to negotiate on the construction of a southern border wall in addition to the existing border infrastructure that the U.S. government has already begun to construct.""

In fact, Mexico has been in negotiations with the Obama administration to build the border wall, as Politico's Mike Allen reported back in October. The U.S. has already built about 1,250 miles of border fence in recent years, with Mexico footing most of the bill.

The White House statement further claims the new discussions with Mexico ""will take place in the context of other bilateral, regional and multilateral initiatives and will not preclude continued cooperation and engagement with our partners on the other aspects of the comprehensive immigration reform.""

In December, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a trip to the White House over a border wall funding bill that he opposed. ""There was an agreement made [in December],"

"In the middle of a game between the Minnesota Wild and Anaheim Ducks, the referee called a penalty on Corey Perry for spearing.

As Perry stood at the scorer's table, the referees informed him that his team was now down a man, and Perry knew he had no choice but to make the ensuing penalty count.

But how was Perry to do so?

As Perry watched his teammates line up for the penalty shot, he pondered the problem.

The goalie on the Ducks was Chris Mason. He's an eight-year NHL veteran who's known as a hard worker, a disciplined player and one who plays the game hard.

He was not the kind of goalie you could put in on the penalty kill, the penalty kill in particular.

As he pondered what he was going to do, he had the same thought as a goaltender:

What would my life be like if I didn't have to think about this penalty shot?

What would it be like to play hockey and not think about how I was going to play the game?

""I started thinking about my family,"" he told reporters. ""If I couldn't be on the penalty kill, what would that mean to my family?"""
"It was only a few hours into a tour of the northern part of the Philippines in August, 2013, and we were walking down a dirt track through dense bamboo thickets. A huge group of local fishermen were out in force. We had to duck behind a bamboo bramble wall and dodge a swarm of insects to reach our boat, a tiny little dinghy with a motor, the kind of boat you'd see at the water's edge.

""My uncle told me the sea is full of fish,"" said my guide, an old fisherman with a broad smile who looked as if he hadn't eaten in weeks.

VICTORIA -- A British Columbia man says he is happy to finally be free after more than a decade behind bars.

Bruce Douglas says he is now able to eat, drink, exercise and even have sex for the first time in 10 years.

""I was locked up in a place that is a prison for the rest of my life. It is very exciting. I've got the freedom and I feel really, really, happy to be free,"" said Douglas, who has a medical marijuana licence.

The Crown's lawyer told court the 44-year-old's licence to possess and grow marijuana will not expire until Oct. 2.

Douglas, from the Lower Mainland, was arrested in January 2006 when he was in a hotel room at the Vancouver Airport and had an ounce of marijuana in his possession.

Douglas said the charge was a result of the B.C. government's failed war on drugs.

The Crown says the Crown has not asked Douglas for any plea agreements and Douglas will plead not guilty at the time of trial.

Douglas said he plans to take advantage of the medical marijuana law and be the first to legally possess cannabis in the Lower Mainland."
"The University of Oklahoma Board of Trustees passed a resolution this afternoon calling for a national study to ""discern the relationship between race, economics and university performance."" The resolution comes after an extensive report from a panel of outside experts found that Oklahoma's public university system is plagued with low graduation rates, a higher dropout rate for minority students, and an academic ""dead-end"" for the majority of students.

""I believe it is critical for the state and the country to examine how the structure and management of higher education has an effect on student outcomes,"" Trustee Kevin Reeder told The Oklahoman.

The resolution also calls on President David Boren to establish a panel to review ""how the current governance structure in Oklahoma is impacting our universities' ability to compete for quality faculty, to attract top faculty, to retain top faculty, and to provide access to educational resources and resources that make a difference in our student learning experiences.""

Boren said that he was disappointed with the vote and that the resolution didn't take into account the findings of the study, but said the university ""has always been a place that is committed to diversity and inclusion, and I intend to work to continue that commitment in the years to come.""

"As of November 9th, 2017, I have changed my mind on my decision to remove the link to my previous review of this game on the website. As you all may know, the review was based on an unprofessional relationship that I had with a representative from the company and, while I appreciate that you have to protect yourself from getting ripped off by the games company, it was an unprofessional, inappropriate, and unnecessary review that I regret ever having to write.

Since that time I have spent considerable time reviewing games that have been reviewed by myself or with a representative. The results of those reviews are not always a perfect, objective, and objective review that can be relied on. What I find to be much more difficult to evaluate is whether a game has a positive, positive impact on my enjoyment and enjoyment of the games that I review. As you may know, my wife is very sensitive about any negativity toward other people or other people's games that we have reviewed, and, unfortunately, the majority of games reviewed by me in the past have had a negative impact on the enjoyment of her time or of other people's time. This was the case for games such as Shadowrun Returns, Star Trek Bridge Crew, and a handful of other titles.

In this video from 2009, Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Hillary Clinton speaks to students at a public college in the South Side of Chicago. (Hillary Rodham Clinton for President)

The video clip — which is dated September 9, 2009, and was filmed at Chicago's Illinois Institute of Technology, where the Democratic presidential candidate was delivering a speech on the ""Economic Insecurity"" of Americans — begins with the candidate explaining the ""crisis"" of rising inequality, which has seen the ""top 10 percent of all wage earners [have] captured an astonishing 86 percent of the growth."" She goes on to talk about a new ""reality"" that is emerging in America — where the wealthiest Americans are taking in more income and the poor and middle class are not. ""I want you to understand what's going on here,"" she said.

"The House has raised the prospect of a new government in a new session of parliament.

It is likely that the election of the Coalition as a one-party state, following a hung parliament, will trigger the need for a fresh election to form a new government.

In a speech in Parliament on Friday morning, Minister for Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop said a new election was likely.

""Given that there has not been a new poll, given that the next election will not occur until 2017 at the earliest, there is the real possibility that we may not have a new government before 2017, but rather in 2017 or later,"" Ms Bishop told Parliament.

"In the summer of 1984, as a junior at Harvard Business School, I was one of two dozen young people at an off-campus party when the police stormed the house, threw our party to the floor and hauled away our host, who had been in a dispute with a roommate. It was a surreal experience, but the police didn't seem particularly bothered. We were the ""criminals of the moment"" and they seemed happy to be rid of us.

It's hard to believe today that we would ever be considered a group of criminals. But that night was one of those times when the American justice system was at its most unkind and we had been singled out as a target for public scorn. It wasn't just a bunch of drunken slackers. We were a bunch of uneducated young men with too much time on our hands who, by definition, lacked the intelligence, self-control, maturity, judgment or character to make sound decisions on our own behalf.

Over the course of the next 20 years, my own legal education was devoted to helping students navigate the system when the police targeted us as ""the worst of the worst."" As I saw firsthand, there's a real price for being the ""worst of the worst,"" as some people"

"In an unprecedented move, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has warned that it will start buying mortgage bonds on Monday if it is unable to increase rates enough to encourage borrowers to take on new loans.

""A strong economic recovery is clearly in the cards for 2015,"" the New York Fed said in a research report. ""If that is not accompanied by increased interest rate flexibility, we may face a sharp slowdown in growth.""

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the U.S. central bank's policymaking panel, met in June and has held seven meetings this year. In all seven of those meetings, the committee has voted to leave rates unchanged, according to a statement.

The central bank's actions on Friday signaled that it was still on track for raising interest rates next year.

The Fed's monetary policy committee decided not to raise its target interest rate for the federal funds rate — the key rate on the $85 trillion federal government's overnight loans — to its second-longest run of record. Instead, it will increase it a quarter of a point at the same time as it leaves it unchanged for longer.

"This week's issue of the New Yorker, written by Michael Lewis and written by Jane Mayer, is out today.

There is much that the book says that should shock even the most hardened New Yorker readers, but there are some that will resonate even with people who know and like Michael Lewis, his friends, his writing and his family.

For instance:

The story is about an insurance executive named John Doe. It is about his decision to join a movement, which has now become known as #BlackLivesMatter, that protests the killings of African-Americans by police. And it is about the power of social media and how it has given an extraordinary voice to a few young African-Americans and Hispanics who feel marginalized in mainstream politics and who are outraged by police treatment of African-Americans and by police misconduct more generally.

That last line, that this ""movement"" is now a ""brand name,"" should shock and anger many New Yorker readers. But that's the way Lewis sees it, and the book is written with a kind of empathy for its subjects, which makes it feel real to some who have seen or been through what they are describing.

The club sold 1,300 tickets on a Sunday night for an opening day game at the newly refurbished Ibrox but failed to pay for all 1,000 of them.

It left fans facing the prospect of being charged an additional fee, which in this case is around £50, when they buy a ticket again in future.

Rangers' general manager, Dave King, admitted he did not realise how much tickets would cost the following week and admitted it had cost them a potential season-ticket holder £400.

"A recent poll found that 70 percent of the population thinks it's okay for people to be fat. But if we were to give this figure any credence, we would find ourselves at a crossroads: How do we accept a world in which we can accept fat people and still have our society work? How do we still call ourselves ""liberal"" while continuing to defend our culture against its biggest enemies, including our own weight-phobic society?

I think this is where the real battle is, not for our ability to accept fat people but for the very foundation of the liberal ideology itself: freedom of expression. We cannot, in fact, defend a world that does not value expression.

There is a fine line between expressing and being offensive. Fat acceptance activists want us to accept people for who they are, without being offended. We're supposed to let the person live as they feel best without our having to question them about it.

"It was the only thing on his mind: making sure his children knew what happened.

It's not an unusual sentiment in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombing, but the day of the bombings is particularly fraught with memories of those who have been killed.

And even now, the most vivid is of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who remains on death row and is slated for a death-row hearing next year.

His younger brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was killed during the attack. He is serving a death sentence after pleading guilty to all 30 charges.

And as the days, weeks, and months have gone by since the bombings, it is becoming harder and harder for Dzhokhar to avoid the past, the fear of what might come next, said his aunt, who is not related to him by blood but still knows his parents.

""The hardest part for me is knowing what has happened, and knowing the details. He's trying to forget it and move on,"" said the aunt, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying that her brother's legal team was pressuring her not to talk.

A spokeswoman for the US attorney's office for the Eastern District of Virginia told The Daily Telegraph the matter was being investigated but said no charges had been brought yet.

"In a recent post I argued that there were good reasons for the Conservative government of Canada to launch an inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women in the North. In this post, I will offer my thoughts on why it may not have made sense for them to launch the inquiry, given that they already knew it had failed in previous years.

To begin, I am going to outline what I see as some of the problems that led the Conservative government to believe that their ""National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls"" was going to succeed. This post will not go into much depth in regards to the facts surrounding the deaths of all those murdered Indigenous women in Canada. Those stories are horrific enough. For the purpose of this post, I am focusing on the deaths of murdered Indigenous women and girls, since the inquiry is not only concerned with their deaths, but also how their deaths are handled in the justice system.

What we have now, after over a year, is a flawed, expensive, and ultimately unproductive inquiry. What is being proposed in the report is not a way forward, and does nothing to improve the situation for Indigenous people. I have some criticisms of the inquiry, but this is not the place to elaborate on that.

"MILWAUKEE -- Milwaukee Brewers left-hander Ryan Braun is back to pitching at an MVP level, his manager said Friday.

Milwaukee manager Craig Counsell said he was happy with his starting pitcher's outing in Wednesday night's game against the Atlanta Braves, the fifth consecutive game Braun had allowed at least six runs and no hits and the first of his career with a quality start.

Braun went eight innings and allowed four hits, walking three and striking out eight, to beat Atlanta 4-2. Braun is tied for second in the National League with five complete games and ranks fifth in ERA. He also has 11 walks compared with 12 strikeouts and has a 0.90 WHIP.

""The confidence is there,"" Counsell said of Braun, who is batting.317 in August. ""I'm excited about him and his potential and he's not doing it by accident.""

The Brewers, who have won their last two games against the Braves, are 13-14 on the season when Braun doesn't start.

The Brewers have not had an MVP in the first three seasons of the new era of manager Jim Leyland and GM Doug Melvin, the only teams in MLB that have had that honor in their three seasons of"
"It's not often you see the most exciting news out of the NFL on a Friday afternoon.

But that was the case for the Chicago Bears.

With a little over three minutes left in the game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Bears wide receiver Eddie Royal got into an argument with a referee. After a review of the play, referee Bill Leavy declared that Royal did not have possession of the ball when he got to the end zone, giving Philadelphia a first down at the Bears' 3-yard line.

It was a bizarre finish to what was an entertaining game between two teams with plenty of talent on both sides of the ball.

But this wasn't just another play where the Bears got a bad call on the field, or another blown call at the wrong moment in the game. This one went viral on Thursday afternoon when Chicago radio talk show host Michael Kay tweeted the following picture:

That was a picture that got tweeted out of nowhere and had the potential to cause quite the controversy. It was even trending on Twitter during the game, which made me wonder why the Bears had chosen not to post it on their Twitter feed, considering it would've been an interesting look into how the team deals with adversity.

"If you have been a part of a team at an organization for more than two years, then you may not realize it but your role as an individual may not have been that of a leader, and your organization may not be a team. The word 'leadership' is defined in many different ways. Here are just a few examples of some of the common definitions of leadership:

Leadership means setting goals for an organization, establishing policies for that organization and defining responsibilities and duties for individuals and teams.

Leadership is the capacity for individuals and organizations to accomplish a common goal or mission. Leadership involves a team effort of a diverse group of individuals working in coordination toward a common purpose. Leadership involves an overall view of an organization, or a shared vision.

Leadership means the ability of a leader to make a difference. Leadership involves making decisions in an effort to bring about a positive result, or an outcome that is more than simply expected or desirable. Leadership means the ability of leaders to provide leadership. Leadership is a means, not an end in itself.

Leadership is a position or authority to make a difference in an organization or community. Leadership involves establishing or maintaining a positive attitude and positive action toward accomplishing the goals of an organization."
"The main goal of the ""Big Tent"" approach is to enable as wide a variety of religious perspectives and ideas as possible within the same faith tradition. While some have questioned whether or not such an approach is even necessary, in light of recent changes in American public life, we think the ""Big Tent"" approach has an important role to play in our faith tradition and in our own understanding of faith, faith-based institutions and religious life.

This ""Big Tent"" approach was pioneered in the early Church and continued through the early part of the 20th Century and has continued to this day in our culture. This ""Big Tent"" approach allows for a wide range of theological and moral positions in the faith tradition. Some people may feel that some theological positions are more ""orthodox"" or more ""in"" with their tradition than others, and it may be a matter of preference. This is fine; but it should not lead to the exclusion of other theological perspectives, as this is a problem that exists in our world and we would do well to remember the teachings of our Church and her Apostles.

As the Church's history demonstrates, it was the Apostles, with their knowledge of the Church's teachings, who led the Church through many crises of faith, as did"
"AUSTIN (KXAN) - Police arrested two suspects who stole more than $7 million from an armored truck during the Labor Day holiday.

Investigators say the men stole the vehicle, loaded with an estimated $7 million worth of military hardware and used the truck to tow more than two dozen vehicles and trailers from a dealership on South Congress. The stolen property was being delivered to various locations throughout Central Texas.

In the past year, Austin Police said the truck was used in over one dozen different thefts. In 2015, police arrested one suspect and said the stolen truck was used in more than 100 separate thefts in Central Texas.

According to Austin Police, the two men in custody were arrested Saturday and face charges of theft, and one of those is for being an accessory after the fact.

Investigators said they have seized more than $2.8 million worth of equipment from the truck.

"As we prepare to celebrate the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Associated Press reported yesterday that ""more than 1,000 people from across the United States"" were arrested last year as a result of a U.S. government sting operation targeting suspected terrorists.

In fact, the sting operations have expanded to include the creation of fake charities and phony social networking sites for terrorists and other criminal elements, the Associated Press reports:

More than 1,000 people from across the United States have been arrested under an undercover government investigation, according to documents obtained by The Associated Press that provide a rare glimpse into how authorities have used confidential informants and sting operations to catch people plotting terror attacks in the U.S. since the 2001 terror attacks.

""These operations are just as important to keeping people safe as the investigative work itself,"" FBI spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood told the AP.

The AP has previously reported on how sting operations have been used to target suspected terrorists:

Since Sept. 11, 2001, authorities have arrested hundreds of suspected terrorists who have used various methods of communication and communications technology to help carry out plots to bomb targets inside the United States or blow up aircraft bound for the U.S.

"A recent survey by the American Lung Association revealed that nearly two out of five children in the US live with an asthma attack at least once a year. While a growing number of kids have managed to successfully manage their asthma through medications, this may be a myth, and may also have serious health implications.

While children with asthma may experience occasional flare ups, they are generally under no greater threat of a lifetime of severe asthma attacks, says Dr. Eric Miller, associate professor at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, and a spokesperson for the American Lung Association. ""There are not as many kids who are chronically at risk for having frequent or severe asthma attacks. You see that a bit more in older kids.""

A few decades ago, the problem was much worse, Miller says, because more children had asthma, but a change in how kids with asthma are diagnosed, diagnosed at a young age and managed led to a decrease in severe attacks in recent decades. ""Asthma was really underdiagnosed and undermanaged. But there's now an increased recognition of the importance of asthma as an asthma risk factor,"" he says.

While kids with asthma have been known to have an increased risk for asthma-related hospitalizations, asthma-related hospitalizations are"

It was during their off-season that the Bills started their long-term plans to move on from quarterback Tyrod Taylor and start their quarterback of the future, Nathan Peterman. The Bills traded up from #17 to #20 overall and selected Peterman with that pick. The Buffalo Bills will look to Peterman to start right away for their new quarterback. The Bills are starting Peterman's career at a new school in the ACC, Pitt, but they'll play in the ACC next season. This is where I'll be giving an analysis on Peterman from his first game of his collegiate career and his transition to the NFL.

Peterman is currently 6th in the nation with an 86.0 QB Rating and 3,965 yards passing, and he also has 22 touchdown passes, 10 interceptions and a 92.4 Total QBR.

"BHUBANESWAR: In an unprecedented step, the government is mulling to levy an excise duty of 10 per cent on alcohol across the state.Sources said the excise duty could be imposed in the next two-three days. The government had recently asked for an increase in excise duty to 14-16 per cent, as per a recommendation by a panel of the central and state government's excise department. The decision to hike the excise duty on alcohol had come under criticism from some political parties who termed the move as a move to make money and had questioned its rationale.However, state excise department sources said the state government is planning to hike the excise duty on alcohol by about Rs 3,000 crore per annum to Rs 35,000 crore. The government has already sanctioned Rs 17,500 crore for excise duty this financial year and a hike is expected to be completed in the current financial year. The increase is being proposed to meet the expenses of the health ministry which will get more revenue from alcohol as excise duty on liquor will be hiked to 18 per cent."

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

As Brazil heads for the 2018 World Cup in June, a series of corruption scandals involving state-run oil companies have drawn new scrutiny to a sports event that's become an icon for Brazil.

As the nation's first World Cup since 1960 draws ever nearer, a series of corruption scandals involving state-run oil companies have drawn new scrutiny to a sports event that's become an icon for Brazil.

Rio's governor was removed last year for a series of graft charges involving a company run by the state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA, better known as Petrobras.

Petrobras also runs the world's third largest oil refinery in Santos, one of the biggest in the country.

Last year's charges, which led to the dismissal of then-Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff and the arrest of several ministers and several company officials, were a huge embarrassment to President Michel Temer, who's seen his approval rating slump.

Temer has promised to clean up the political culture that led to the graft and corruption charges and is looking to be less dependent on Petrobras, which accounts for one in three of Brazil's GDP and is Brazil's top employer.

"""When it comes to our ability to reach the most vulnerable Americans, our party and our nation have failed,"" Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), the Democratic leader, said at the same news conference.

Democrats and Republicans are negotiating how to overhaul the health care law. A bill under negotiation would keep many of the same policies and keep in place the subsidies, tax penalties and other aspects of the Affordable Care Act that the House approved earlier this year, but it would leave much of the rest of the law untouched, and Republicans and some Democrats are hoping to revive a more comprehensive proposal.

Republicans in Congress are divided over their plan for the law and how far to push to make changes to the Affordable Care Act.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected that 13 million people would lose insurance as a result of the House Republican bill to dismantle the 2010 Affordable Care Act. It has not released a projection on what effect the Senate's health bill would have.

But Republicans on Capitol Hill have long warned that the repeal and replace bill will cut health insurance subsidies that help low-income people pay for insurance and would cut Medicaid, which covers poor Americans, children, pregnant women, seniors and those with disabilities.

A suicide bombing by militants from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria killed dozens of people, most of them in a Baghdad restaurant where Shiites gather for evening prayers.

It was the latest in a string of attacks across the country in the past three years, and the worst since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, when a large bomb ripped through a crowded street in downtown Baghdad. The deadliest attack in the city's history was at a cafe popular with Shiites and other groups in April 2010, in which at least 80 people were killed.

In addition to the killing in the restaurant, which happened as diners were celebrating a Shia Muslim holiday, militants struck in a market in a Sunni Muslim area in the western city of Baiji and in the town of Karrada in Anbar Province in western Iraq. In a separate attack in Baghdad's southern al-Qasr neighbourhood, five people were killed.

The NCPCR will hold its annual session from December 18 to 20 in New Delhi and it has proposed that a draft proposal for this proposal will be presented at its first meeting, according to an official source.

""It is a proposal of a committee which has been constituted for this purpose,"" a senior government official said. ""We have started to study the medical and psychological aspect of it, so we are looking to put the proposal to a Cabinet committee.""

""This will help them. If it works as expected, this would mean they (parents) can be held liable for the health and physical well being of their children.""

According to a 2011 study by the NCPCR,"
"The B.C. Liberal party says the government is ignoring evidence that it's not a tax-dodging, out-of-control bureaucracy, but rather a business that has grown too big to be left to fend for itself.

It's a critique the B.C. Green Party says it shares.

In a news release, B.C. Green Party leader Andrew Weaver called on the NDP to ask Finance Minister Mike de Jong to clarify the Liberal government's position on the B.C. government-owned corporation, Crown Corporations and Financial Corporation Act (FFCA), as he plans to raise it as a point of debate during the party's election campaign in March.

"If you want to start a small business and start with the least amount of risk, consider doing business in Mexico.

It is easier than you might think. There is less to lose in Mexico compared to your home country. And it doesn't have to be a large company or even an existing one to get started.

Startups have access to an incredibly affordable loan system, a lower business tax rate than your home country and a long-established business environment that has proven it is possible to make a business thrive in the region.

You can also work from the comfort of your own home or from a remote office, all the while getting access to the resources that your home country might have, if it has one at all.

That is a lot to digest right now, so here is a brief overview of why Mexico might be a better place to start a small business than the rest of the world:

Lower operating cost. The average annual wage in Mexico is US$7,400 and it has the fourth highest percentage of entrepreneurs who started a small business than the world, according to the World Bank. It is also ranked higher than the U.S. and Japan in terms of the number of businesses.

"""I've heard some pretty interesting things,"" says Dr. Andrew Wakefield of the University of Oxford's department of paediatrics and global health.

A prominent British medical journal, the Lancet, retracted a 1998 study claiming to have linked the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine with autism and bowel inflammation. Now, in the most thorough peer review ever carried out of an anti-vaccination theory, Dr. Wakefield and colleagues in England and Canada say there's a ""clear lack of evidence"" to back their findings, which had been touted as the last hope in a century-old controversy over vaccination.

But Dr. Wakefield and other doctors, who are now challenging the original Lancet study and calling for more thorough analyses, are undaunted, even as their critics say the new evidence has shaken the credibility of the scientific establishment.

The authors of a recent article published in The BMJ called for a ""global moratorium on vaccination"" in response to the new Lancet report.

""There is no evidence that vaccination causes autism or that it does not,"" wrote the authors. They add that there are ""too many confounders"" for there to be any convincing evidence that MMR is unsafe.

"The City Council hasThe city will pay the federal government $5,000 a year to cover the costs of administering a program that offers low-cost HIV tests.

The money was provided to the city by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention under an agreement signed last year between the federal and state health agencies.

""This agreement will enable us to offer this service to those who would be unable to otherwise access it,"" said councilor Michael Coan, who was instrumental in reaching a deal with the state to cover the costs of the HIV/AIDS screening.

""This program is about being a model for the country, and the city will continue to work with our partners to improve public health.""

The testing program was established in response to an epidemic of HIV among intravenous drug users in the city, Coan said. The state offered funding to cover the program, and the federal government stepped in with money for the testing.

""There have been a number of deaths due to drug overdoses,"" Coan said.

"Mumbai, Jan 19 (IANS) The government on Sunday approved an amendment to the Maharashtra Coastal Regulation Zone Act, 2005 that allows fishermen to keep their fishing boats on the coast when they are engaged in the ""economic activities"".

The Coastal Zone Management Act was amended to include this provision on the last day of the monsoon session of the Maharashtra Assembly, a day before it was to come into force on Monday.

The amendment was approved by the government after opposition Congress and the Left parties, as well as the Communist Party of India-Marxist and the Congress party, had demanded that fishermen be given the freedom to use fishing vessels, especially to keep a ""stray fleet"" from entering the marine conservation area.

The fishermen would also have to give up other economic activities like collecting shells.

The coastal regulation zone has a strict ban on commercial fishing activities. The ban on the fishing fleet would also be effective for three years from the date of its registration, which could be in October 2013.

The coastal zone management law has provisions for enforcement against the use of boats to violate the zone by keeping stray vessels and to stop the entry of foreign vessels to the protected zone.

— David Scott, president and CEO, Royal Dutch Shell, after an investigation found the crew had entered an underwater gas pipe.

It was a week ago Monday, Aug. 30, when a Royal Dutch Shell team, conducting an oil rig safety drill on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico, came upon an unexpected and deadly scene: The rig was not under control and it had lost propulsion.

A group of BP's oil and gas rigs, all operating in the Gulf, were on fire and Shell, the most experienced company in the Gulf, had not responded for a decade.

Shell had been under pressure to respond. On Wednesday, it issued an emergency alert on its website and said it had responded. But it said that, in fact, Shell's response team had lost control and it was ""likely"" the crew of the platform, owned by Halliburton, had caused the accident.

The first thing Bishop Maas will be tasked with addressing as chair of the committee is ensuring the church continues its focus on poverty, poverty issues and justice in a changing America. ""We must remain committed to the 'culture of life' that is a part of the Christian life and we must work with others in this area to promote that mission.""

""It's really important that the church is involved in these issues,"" Bishop Maas told LifeSiteNews in an interview at his offices in Durham, N.C.

""We know that in our nation, especially in the South, the churches have not been engaged in poverty or justice work,"" he added.

Hello, My name is Brandon. I'm a senior at a school called Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, and I was born and raised here in Los Angeles. My mom, my father and I moved here in 1998 and my parents got us all enrolled at Loyola Marymount, so that is where my story really starts. I've had the pleasure of meeting some great people here in my school and I feel so fortunate to have had this chance to do this, and I hope you all do, too.

I was going through a breakup in May, and it was during this time that my boyfriend, who is also a student, said he had a lot to offer me and I didn't have much to say back to him. So he told me about this great new school I had never heard of called Loyola Marymount and that I should at least try it out. He asked if I knew any of its graduates, so I sent him a couple links and we started talking. The day he said it was time to try out for the school, I showed up and I had the worst anxiety I'd ever experienced in my life.

"ROBIN LOVECRAFT (1890-1957)

In this extraordinary autobiography, Lovecraft describes his early years, his early experiments in magic and religion, his relationship with his uncle Wilmarth, and the adventures he and his brother shared during a childhood trip to the American southwest. The book includes his stories, stories that Lovecraft considers to be ""his greatest accomplishment"".

Synopsis: The only son of an itinerant physician, Robert Louis ""Robert"" Culp Lovecraft was raised in New Hampshire's Methuen, a prosperous New England town of roughly 750 people. Though a talented amateur writer and painter, Lovecraft never developed the skill or talent necessary to support him. In the 1880's he and his brother Wilmarth traveled extensively in the southwestern United States and the Pacific Northwest. There Lovecraft met his first love, and for several years they lived in harmony until the elder Lovecraft became disillusioned by his brother's belief that the Earth was infested by ""an immense, silent race of men and women"" and the ""fungi of a vast, dark, unknown, and unhallowed planet"".

"This is an interesting topic. There is no one reason, but it appears to be the case. When the car is stopped by law enforcement, they are searching the vehicle for something that is not actually there. The problem is, if the person who is stopped has something that is not there, there is nothing to stop them. If a police officer wants to search someone's vehicle for something that isn't there, he must either get consent to do the search or have a search warrant. But in most jurisdictions, police can stop a vehicle and do nothing without having to have a warrant or the person have consent. The issue of consent to a search has been in the news lately with the arrest of the man in Florida for possession of cocaine, even though no drugs were found. There is also an ongoing lawsuit in Ohio (PDF) concerning an illegal stop of an auto. In both these situations, there are good arguments in favor of having consent and consent laws that provide protections to people in possession of drugs and drugs in general, and this is where the confusion is.


I will make some comments here to the discussion about the drug exception, and the general problem that police face in terms of the law regarding consent to a search. It is important to remember that police"

"In a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) the scientists suggest that the changes in the ocean temperature due to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may cause some of the major factors affecting ocean chemistry and carbonate chemistry, such as dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), to become less predictable over time. This has a negative effect on the ocean's ability to buffer against future warming and therefore potentially affect oceanic productivity, food web structure and carbon sequestration. The results were generated by the Earth System Research Laboratory's Climate Dynamics group at the University of Maryland (UMD), USA and were published in a special edition of PNAS titled, ""A Climate of Change and its Effects on the Ocean and the Biosphere"", co-authored by UMD climate scientist Robert Kopp, who led the research team.

In recent decades, global average temperatures have been rising and human activity, principally caused by human carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions, has caused significant warming. However, ocean heat content, which accounts for most of this warming, has remained stable since about 1970 and in many ocean regions ocean heat content is rising. Ocean acidification, due to increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and other greenhouse gases, has been increasing as"

The USA has yet to defeat Mexico in a match since a 2-1 win in Mexico in October 1997, when it was coached by former USA head coach Bruce Arena.

Mr. Trump, who is expected to release more tax returns during the presidential campaign, has refused to release his previous returns. Mr. Trump and his advisers say they have not yet been audited and therefore would not have to release their returns if he were a public company.

But tax lawyers have warned that, under the tax law, any business entity that has an owner who does not pay federal taxes would have to release the returns. Mr. Trump and his advisers have argued that his returns would not shed much light on the many issues that could have been examined in audits, including whether he has the personal wealth to make a donation to the U.S. Treasury to settle claims that his businesses may have paid too little.

A federal court judge in Manhattan issued an order in January, however, allowing the New York attorney general to obtain Mr. Trump's returns and compel them to be released, after an anonymous donor threatened to sue. Mr. Trump has vowed to appeal that ruling.

The most significant revelation of the documents is how many of Mr. Trump's companies paid little in taxes"

The officer was initially assigned a name of a different race but, after complaints about the name, was changed to the gender-neutral ""Robert Neller"" this month, officials at the school said.

Robert Neller was chosen because of the former president's legacy on racial integration, and also to avoid confusion with the name of a U.S. Marine Corps general and the actor Robert Duvall, a former West Point graduate, West Point officials said.

Neller, who graduated in 2000 and joined the school's faculty last fall, was introduced to students last month and sworn in by Army Maj. Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti. He is the second African American to join the U.S. military's top officer rank in the last 10 months.

Step 1: Take it off

If your cellphone has been dead for a long time and you don't think it'll ever work again, you should remove the battery from the phone before it is thrown away or destroyed. It is a good idea to take it off first and put it away before putting on something else that requires your attention.

Step 2: Install the new battery

Next, install the replacement battery in your phone and let"

"If you haven't been keeping up on all things Marvel, you probably don't know that the studio's upcoming Captain America 3 has already been released online in its entirety. There is also a trailer for the film, and as a result, a whole bunch of footage has made its way online, with a number of people noticing the same things we have seen: Captain America's shield has the word ""Goddess"" inscribed on it in big black letters, and it seems that he's been holding that shield as long as he has been in this movie, but he hasn't had a shield to wield for a long time.

As far as I'm concerned, the Shield of the Goddess has always been Captain America, and there is absolutely no way it was meant to be anything but. I don't believe this to be a mistake or an error or something. This is a real shield, with no errors on the engraving. If you're an actual deity, and you see the words ""Goddess,"" then you must be a very powerful person indeed, because it is you who is responsible for this shield's engraving. It's not Captain America's fault. This shield belongs to the Goddess.

Of course, some of the"
"In an attempt to get out in front of the rising number of online gambling companies opening in New Jersey, a bill to outlaw online poker in the state passed its first hearing Tuesday night.

Introduced by Assemblywoman Rose Marie Alesia, a Camden County Democrat, the bill is set for a full floor vote by the full Assembly as soon as the Assembly is back in session on Nov. 1. The Senate approved a similar measure in March, but the House is likely to take a longer view, perhaps a few more days.

Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver, a North Bergen Republican, said in an email she ""welcomed the committee's passage"" and hoped to bring it to a vote by the Assembly as early as Wednesday.

""As the bill continues to gain support, it will be debated and considered at length, as I anticipate the Senate to be ready with similar legislation to pass by the end of this session,"" Oliver said. ""In the meantime, I have instructed staff to draft and submit a companion bill in the House that will further prohibit this practice in New Jersey.""

"""We don't have enough good ideas for this country to fix. It's the opposite. We don't have enough good ideas.""

– Bernie Sanders, September, 2016

""There are good people of every political persuasion here, who are doing a good job,"" Sanders said in an August 2015 interview.

Sanders and Trump have often spoken of the need for a more vigorous discussion on policy. Both men have talked of the need for the country to invest in education and infrastructure, both men have spoken about the need for more competition in the healthcare market. Both men have spoken of the need to expand Social Security.

But what has distinguished Sanders, Trump, and Sanders's supporters has been a shared belief in a larger vision of American politics that they believe is lacking in our national discourse. In this essay I will focus on the differences between the two political movements and discuss some of the common threads between Sanders' and Trump's platforms.

Bernie Sanders

Bernie Sanders is not the most eloquent speaker on the American political spectrum. He often appears more like an intellectual, an old-fashioned politician, a politician of the people. In a July, 2015 speech to the AFL-CIO, Sanders told his audience of workers that the goal"

We don't know how the game of basketball is going to change. We know that a program in this community can be an asset. A program that has the ability to go out and really do what I want to do as far as putting the right kind of people on the team, getting the right kind of culture, bringing them along the way that I think you have to go to do this thing I'm doing here in Milwaukee and in Milwaukee in a different way. We know that there is an opportunity there. It's a very real possibility. The reality of the game is, I know that there's an opportunity out there to change the way things are going on in the country and around the world. So this is an opportunity I can't let go by without taking advantage of."

"If you want to find a job with the potential for long term success in the private sector, it pays to be able to speak your mind, write a compelling cover letter and to show your academic record.

Here's some advice to get you started:

Write your cover letter to attract and keep a job applicant, not to get your own application noticed.

Use a resume and cover letter as a way of creating an engaging cover letter, not just to send.

A strong cover letter can be more persuasive than your CV or a personal statement.

Have a few sample pages to get you started, or ask for one if you don't have any yet.

As an example of the sort of thing I'd recommend, here are my cover letters for the private sector jobs I've been able to land recently:

"REST API (and Mux) for Postgres

Introduction

REST API (or mux) is a technology that enables applications to be accessed asynchronously by different clients. For instance, when an API service wants to return a list of items from its collection, it calls its REST API and, on the client side, returns the data to the API service. This makes REST APIs an excellent mechanism to deliver dynamic information in the most efficient and reliable way possible.

This is an implementation of the mux library, written in Python and Postgres, for the Python standard library, to serve as a convenient reference for this technology. It can be used with Python versions 3.4 and 5.5.

Note: the code has been tested only against Python 3.4, not against the newest PostgreSQL releases.

This code has not been reviewed or endorsed by Postgres Global Development Group and may change without notice.

Getting started

If you have a Postgres installation with psql, run psql postgres --database postgres. This will connect to your Postgres installation as the database postgres. You can also install Postgres with a Python virtualenv, and install the package from the virtual environment"
"""There is no room for confusion: It's our job to ensure that no matter how much you want to believe something is the truth, the only way you can truly believe that something is the truth is if you know for a fact that it isn't true."" —Liam Neeson

So what is the difference between a belief, a theory and a guess? What makes something a belief?

When someone believes in something, they know they have good evidence that this something is the case. That is what we call evidence, or 'hard facts.' If the person doesn't believe in something, they may still be aware that something is true, but they aren't able to know with 100% certainty that this something is true. They might just have an 'hunch' that it is true, but not with 100% certainty. They might have an idea that they could be wrong about some details, but not 100% certainty. They could still be reasonably sure that the thing in question is the truth, but not 100%.

Now, when someone guesses, they don't actually know what is going on, so they may just guess based on some vague sense of something, which in the case of the world being 10 feet tall is often"

"This week I wanted to share something a bit different for this week. A recipe I've been meaning to try for a long time. This one is from The Cheesemonger, the blog of The Cheesemaker.

They have an incredible cheesemaker on board, who I was so fortunate enough to speak to this past weekend. Her name is Sara. She has worked in the cheese business for many years and has an amazing recipe book on hand for every cheesemaker's reference. Her recipes are incredibly well executed. They're simple enough that anyone could follow them. And her presentation is amazing, showing all of her creations and her love of cheese and the ingredients.

One thing I've learned from Sara is to not use anything you have on hand in the recipe, even if it's easy to find. It's just as easy to find what you need from another recipe, so try to get creative when possible.

The cheesemaker, who I can only imagine is an amazing lady, used this as her inspiration to create these amazing chocolate peanut butter bites. The only changes she made was that she substituted peanut butter for the chocolate. You can really taste the peanut butter and it's really not noticeable at all in these. I found her"
"The Department of Education, in collaboration with the State Board of Education and the Massachusetts Association of Schools and Programs (MASP), have announced the final results of their public hearing process in Boston to review the application and funding proposal from the Massachusetts School Building Authority. The hearing process, which concluded today, was one of several in Boston and Boston suburbs, where the proposal was received by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BEST) in January 2015.

The BEST board unanimously voted to recommend approval of the MASP's proposal and the application fee to be collected from schools across Massachusetts.

""We appreciate the work and dedication of all the individuals who have worked tirelessly to complete this hearing,"" said MASP Chair, Carol Corbin, ""and look forward to moving forward with the application.""

In their report to BEST, MASP reviewed the MASP proposal and made several key recommendations for improving the performance of school facilities, which are not always up to code. Specifically, the MASP recommended:

Eliminate the use of lead in pipes that enter classrooms

Expand and replace aging, aging, and unneeded water supply and plumbing fixtures

"""This is an interesting question,"" said Mr. Grunfeld. ""It depends on who you're asking and what they're asking, because if you're asking, 'Should I start a new company,' it would depend on the kind of company you were looking for, because the idea of being in business for a while is not a good business proposition, but it is a very different type of business proposition when you're talking about the Internet business, which is the only thing you can do on the Internet that has the ability to disrupt traditional media businesses.

"As you might expect, a number of players were disappointed with the news. ""We're a professional football club and it's important for us to show respect for the flag,"" said Newcastle captain Fabricio Coloccini, ""but the decision to wear armbands at all has to be taken on a case-by-case basis.

""If you take it a step further, it could mean you don't get on the plane if you don't agree.

""It's an emotional time. There is a lot of disappointment for some of the players, but they need to get behind their manager.""

However, Newcastle were far from alone. The players were not allowed to fly flags to mark the occasion at their respective clubs' games and their manager's refusal to wear the armbands was condemned as a lack of respect.

At Arsenal, Wenger had a row with the players, insisting he could not be ""politicised"" over the matter, while at Tottenham he refused to fly his team's colours.

It seems a peculiar thing to demand from players, especially given the number of clubs in the Premier League which don't allow flags or other signs to be flown.

"BRILLIANT! The way I saw it, this is an excellent movie, one that's probably going to have a very long run as a movie, and is going to have an incredibly strong influence on the genre as a whole, not only the horror genre. The movie's atmosphere and story is unique, the way it deals with its characters and its atmosphere is very well thought out and thought-out, it's also got great special effects and one of the best and most convincing sets ever done on the screen, with a very believable set design and an atmosphere that feels right and authentic.

It's just an overall really good movie and if you haven't seen it, go see it now. The fact that it's available in digital form is great news because I have seen this film twice now on my DVR. The second time was in theaters and I really loved it. The fact that it's available online means it'll be more easily accessible for new viewers and more easily available to anyone who may be curious to see this.

"The San Jose Earthquakes are still trying to get past their last-place status, and their playoff chances may not get better until the team begins to put together some of its more potent attacks.

That was the message of coach Dominic Kinnear during the club's final practice before Sunday's home opener against the Vancouver Whitecaps. The Quakes head coach also revealed that the Quakes were targeting a midfielder and defender in this weekend's MLS trade deadline.

""The last thing I would like to see is to sit and watch us and not think that there are moves we're doing to get better,"" Kinnear told reporters following practice at Buck Shaw Stadium on Thursday. ""That's the challenge. If I was the other coach in your office and you were trying to build a championship team and I said, 'Here are five pieces to make us better,' it'd be pretty difficult to say that's going to make you a better team. That's a different league than Major League Soccer. I think that's where we're at now.""

"It is with deep regret and heavy heart that we must announce the death of the late, great, and great-grandson of Sir Isaac Newton. Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was one of the most prolific scientists of the Age of Enlightenment and his ideas influenced many of the greatest minds of the twentieth century, most notably Albert Einstein. He is remembered as one of the founders of the scientific method and one of the fathers of modern science.

In recent years, the great Isaac Newton (1642–1727) has become more widely known for the scientific breakthroughs that he made with the law of universal gravity and the theory of relativity, the theory that has helped shape modern physics, but for centuries his ideas were mostly forgotten and he was regarded by most people as an obscure character from a bygone age. In recent decades, however, his scientific ideas have begun to attract wider interest and now he has become a highly revered and much admired scientist.

Isaac Newton was born on Christmas Day 1642 at Wotton in Lincolnshire, England. His mother was the widow of the Reverend Robert Boyle and the young Isaac Newton's father was an artisan who worked in a textile shop in the city. After completing his studies, Newton entered the University"
"A year after the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, many in the gun-owning community remain committed to the notion that the massacre was ""just a movie,"" and that armed guards could have stopped it.

However, according to the National Rifle Association, a full-fledged ""security"" operation in the New York City school district, with armed personnel and security cameras, was in fact in the works.

In the days after the massacre at Sandy Hook, which took the lives of 26 children and adults, the NRA said the plan to hire armed personnel at all schools was a ""further step to ensure our schools remain a safe place to learn, play and thrive.""

It is a point the NRA's chief lobbyist, Wayne LaPierre, has reiterated in the months since. ""In the face of repeated terrorist threats against public school children, I've asked the NRA-ILA to consider how best to provide for our nation's school children in a way that will make us safer.""

And last year, as the gun rights lobby began to shift from a campaign of demonizing ""the government"" and ""socialist"" to an effort of ""disarmament and restoration"" to its core base, it became clear the organization's response to"
"In an interview with CNN on Monday, Donald Trump said he would be ""the first and only candidate in this race who is self funding his campaign,"" as a way of raising funds for his presidential campaign.

The New York real estate developer's statement that he is going to run an ""unpaid, authentic campaign"" that he said ""has never taken a dime from donors or PACs"" was an unusual admission in a political environment where politicians are under scrutiny for how much they personally donate to campaigns.

The billionaire, who has spent millions on TV ads and on a presidential primary campaign in which he is widely seen as the Republican nominee, is facing mounting pressure from many of his fellow Republicans to make more disclosure about how much money he and his family have spent on their campaign.

The fact that he's taking on the issue of self-funding with the kind of specificity Trump displayed Monday may help to increase his stature as an unconventional candidate, one that many of his opponents have failed to take on in this campaign season.

In recent weeks, U.S. and Cuban diplomats have been celebrating the reestablishment of full diplomatic ties that have been suspended since the 1959 Cuban revolution, according to officials with the State Department. The U.S. is currently reviewing Cuba's compliance with a series of agreements on the U.S.-Cuban detente and other matters that were part of the so-called ""decommunization"" deal reached in 2014.

""Cuba's return to the United States' embassy in Havana is a significant milestone for U.S.-Cuba relations, which were severely disrupted after President Obama's announcement that he was restoring diplomatic relations with Cuba in December 2014,"" a senior U.S. State Department official told CNN.

The official, speaking on background because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the diplomatic exchanges, added: ""Cuba's decision to resume U.S. relations with the State Department in Havana is also significant, as this is the first time in almost a half-century that a government in Havana has chosen to"
"The main feature of the article is a video presentation on the latest work on the Linux Kernel. It was given at the Linux Kernel Summit in Germany. The video was produced by a team led by Marko Rokšanović. It shows some interesting aspects of the kernel in action:

A live performance of a single task. The work was done with a combination of real and simulated tasks, to produce the best performance. The simulated work was performed using an ARM Cortex-M0 processor. The work was also performed using a single thread of an x86-64 CPU, which can achieve the same results with a more efficient setup. The simulated tasks are not very difficult to implement, so they are a good choice to simulate performance in real environments. The real work, done on the CPU and simulated on the GPU, were run in parallel to achieve a higher performance. The kernel used an x86-64 kernel and a version with CONFIG_X86_64=y, which makes it possible to use all CPU cores in parallel. This allows the Linux Kernel to achieve a good balance of CPU and GPU performance, as well as providing good CPU scheduling capabilities.

An example of kernel tuning and optimization, based on the latest Linux Kernel 3."
"The number of children in England who have not lived in a single-parent household for the last three years has more than doubled since 2010, research for the Institute for Fiscal Studies has found.

In the first survey of its kind, the think-tank found that one in six children – more than 5 million children – were not living with at least one of their biological parents in 2011. The figure has risen to 1 in 7, compared to one in 12 children in 2010, and more than a quarter of all children now live with one or two non-parental carers, compared with 21 per cent in 2010.

The survey, which analysed government data on child poverty and children in England, was based on more than 90,000 children aged 13 and above and covered the last three years of government. It showed that children of families in low-paid, part-time or part-year employment were much more likely to live in a family without their parents. The average wage of the children was £21,200 in 2011-12.

In contrast, children whose families had more money were much less likely to live without a parent, the think-tank found.

The think-tank, which has previously said there has been an"
"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

JUAN GONZÁLEZ: We end our show now with a new poll showing that Donald Trump is now tied in the state of New York with Democrat Hillary Clinton. The RealClearPolitics poll average in the state is Trump up by less than 1,000 votes, although there have been several high-profile recounts. The results have come after New York's top court ordered a state-wide recount in the presidential race on Thursday, citing irregularities in voting totals. On Saturday, Trump conceded, tweeting that it was ""very possible"" the recount would prove a ""waste of money and time"" and saying, ""So much time and money will be spent—done for nothing! DemocRATS out!""

AMY GOODMAN: But the real question now is what will happen on Election Day, when millions of New York residents are heading to the polls? Well, the New York State Board of Elections will be holding its own recount of the presidential vote in New York, beginning next Tuesday.

"If you're reading this, chances are you're not alone in your need to get to the bottom of a mysterious rash that's spreading through your neighborhood. The rash, which looks like it was triggered by the flu, is characterized by a large, red blotch on your body and, on rarer occasions, on your clothes, shoes or skin.

Doctors can't yet say how this rash started, but some think that the virus has crossed a cellular membrane, such as the skin. This is similar to a viral infection, such as a cold.

While the rash doesn't typically affect more than 1 or 2 percent of people, it's a serious condition. And because the condition can cause fever and a runny nose and diarrhea, people who get the rash should watch for symptoms that suggest an illness. If you suspect you may have the rash, contact your health care provider as soon as possible.

""This rash is serious because it is very contagious,"" said Dr. Michael W. Fruchtl, medical director for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

How you're spreading it

"It's that time of the month again. You've got a little more cash in your wallet. You've got a little more time in your schedule. You want to hit the gym and lose a little bit of that flab, or at least get it to the right shape for some cardio and some weight training. You know that you'll have more energy, your body will be better able to function and you will probably look better for it. So, what should you do?

For most people, there is only one right way. But, there's no one right way. You have to do what feels right for you, for your situation. Here are some general rules I recommend that you follow to keep your workouts moving forward, whether it's at home, the gym, on vacation or anyplace in between.

Rule #1: Pick Your Goals

This may be a no-brainer for the fitness junkie, but if you are in a gym or working out in your living room, this one will take some effort on your part. Pick the goal you want to hit for a given workout, and make it realistic. Do not, I repeat do not, give yourself goals that will be impossible for you to reach. For example"
"It was a bizarre scene that played out Wednesday evening when a woman accused Republican U.S. Senate nominee Roy Moore of attempting to rape her when she was 16-years-old in a small Alabama town more than two decades ago.

A woman who told The Washington Post she was 17 years old during Moore's alleged assault in the late 1980s told The New York Times that Moore made her kneel on his desk while he sexually assaulted her and tried to force her hand down his underwear. The woman said that while she was in her pajamas she awoke to find the door open and Moore standing there, staring at her. She said Moore attempted to force her hand down his underwear before she managed to pull it back. She said that as she pulled on the door she noticed a ""very large bulge"" under the sheet that Moore had left there, and she said Moore left her with the impression that she would not be believed because she was too young and he was a powerful, famous politician.

Moore has repeatedly denied the allegations made against him and has even filed a lawsuit in response.

In a series of tweets on Thursday, Trump responded to the accusations and said that if the accusations were true they were a ""total disgrace and disgrace"""
"In an unprecedented move, the Obama administration today ordered the removal of U.S. citizens suspected of providing financial support for terror groups in Iran and Lebanon. The administration's actions were made after Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized control of the capital Sana'a and threatened the Saudi Arabian border. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis and other Shiite Houthi militias in Yemen is now battling a rapidly advancing force in the port of Aden that has also included fighters linked to Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).

""Iran's sponsorship of terrorist activity has to be exposed for the blatant danger it poses,"" President Barack Obama said in a statement announcing the action. ""These sanctions will disrupt the finances of the Revolutionary Guards, including the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. They will also target other Iranian-based entities that provide material support for terrorist activities and individuals and entities involved in the ballistic missile program.""

The Obama administration announced that it was also ordering U.S. citizens and businesses to cut all financial ties to companies, individuals, and other entities it deemed ""associated with terrorist-related activities in Iran."" The president's statement made clear that U.S. citizens could face ""serious consequences,"" but added, ""we have chosen not to impose"
"The B.C. Liberal party is proposing changes to how it awards nomination money to ridings across the province, but party leader John Horgan is suggesting the proposed changes don't go far enough to fix the party's nomination problems.

The B.C. Liberals have had difficulty filling Liberal-held seats on council in some urban ridings, where a shortage of candidates is driving up costs, said Horgan, who is expected to release his first budget as leader Tuesday.

The Liberals' problems were revealed in a May 2017 Globe and Mail analysis, which found the party was giving nomination money to just 44 per cent of all candidates running for a nomination, a problem that led the Liberals to raise $6 million to fund more nomination races.

""Our party is in crisis,"" Horgan told reporters Thursday in the legislature. ""I have spoken to every riding chair today and asked them how we're going to solve it and what they are doing about it and the answer has been, we have no clue. It is very simple: the nomination process in the party has been broken for many years and this is one of the major causes.""

The family told officers that they had last seen him walking alone near the corner of Bowery and West Stuyvesant in the Bronx, according to police.

He was wearing a blue hoodie, a light blue and gray plaid jacket and blue jeans. He also was carrying a red backpack."
"This post was updated to reflect a response from the City of Chicago.

On Saturday, June 6th, the Chicago Fire will host Real Salt Lake in a rematch of their 2013 Eastern Conference Semifinals first leg match at Toyota Park.

This year's meeting is also a rematch of last year's first leg match, when Chicago scored two first half goals in an 8-1 demolition. RSL goalkeeper Nick Rimando was on hand to see both matches and made an observation to me this morning, when asked about his memory of this season's matchup.

""It was a hard-fought match,"" Rimando told me this morning. ""The last few times we played them, I don't know if they really improved, but last year they came back and I thought it was a really tough game.""

The Fire came away with a 2-2 draw on their second attempt against Real Salt Lake in Salt Lake in the 2012 Eastern Conference Semifinal. This match was not only the last of a two-game stretch in the conference for Real Salt Lake, it also marked the final home game for former Chicago Fire forward Nat Borchers.

"In an article titled 'How I Quit Smoking', author John Hopkins says that quitting is 'like the beginning of a long, difficult, and costly battle, one that cannot be won.'

According to Hopkins, people who have not been successful in their attempts to quit are at an elevated risk of suffering a wide range of serious medical complications such as stroke, heart disease, and respiratory illness, which may ultimately kill them.

But Hopkins does not think that the benefits of quitting are as clear-cut as they may initially appear to be.

The article is written for the International Journal of Public Health and published online. It has since been taken down.

He wrote: 'A substantial proportion of people who attempt to quit smoking continue to smoke when they quit, even years after they have been unsuccessful in stopping smoking.

'These are the ""stubborn smokers"" and ""chronic smokers"" that clinicians should be aware of, since their smoking habits pose a serious and avoidable public health concern.'

In a separate article entitled 'Cancer Risk Among Former Smokers: The Missing Link to Cigarette Cessation?' author Paul F. Thacker says that the cancer risks of quitting smoking are unclear and should not be exaggerated."
"A lot of people don't understand why it's hard for us to say no. Why does it take us so long to say ""No"" when it's not what we really want?

If I'm in a good mood, and I want something from someone else, I feel like it's a given that they'd say ""Yes"". That's just the way I'm wired, so it feels right. But if I'm feeling bad, and I want to tell them I want something, then they have a lot more power in deciding how to react to me, than I would ever give them credit for.

So here are some reasons why we feel like it's OK to say ""no"":

1. We want to be nice to you

It feels good to be nice, so it makes sense to be nice to them, even if that's not what we want to say. If someone doesn't like you, you feel like you don't need to make any effort to change that. You might think, ""It doesn't really matter, they just don't like me."" And if you really want to be nice to someone, then you do, right?

Wrong.

"""If we get an invitation to play them we'll certainly give it a look,"" the 21-year-old said. ""But at this stage it's hard to say because we're only just coming through pre-season.""

With the potential to be among the biggest names on the international scene next summer, it will be fascinating to see whether he has the same desire as a number of others in his position.

The teenager said: ""It would be really nice to get the chance to play against a Premier League club and be able to impress a few of the other young lads.

""But as things stand it would be pretty difficult. It would probably be the only game we would play at that stage in the Premier League and then it's on to Europe.""

Although he said he is still a few weeks away from making any sort of decision on whether he wants to be an Arsenal player in the future, it's a move which will interest a number of his club-mates, especially considering it will give them the chance to get to know him.

""I don't know who I will play alongside yet, but there is no doubt I have got some great teammates in there who are all hungry to do well and"
"Maurizio Sarri's team have lost just one game so far in Serie A, with Juventus taking a 2-1 win at home to Milan

Juventus' victory at AC Milan in midweek means they will be Serie A's top scorers in 2017/18 with 39 goals - with Juventus are the only side that will reach that mark by winning all their remaining games.

They have a comfortable lead over Napoli with the Bianconeri scoring 28 goals more than second-placed Roma.

Napoli are a point behind the champions with 35 goals scored and Napoli will also overtake Juventus on goals scored this season.

Alessio Cerci has scored 10 goals so far in all competitions - and will be one of the highest scorers in all competitions next term.

With 37 goals in 38 league games in his second campaign with the Serie A club, he will top the charts in his fourth campaign, following in the footsteps of Diego Forlan (2009-11), Eusebio and Dida (2005-07 and 2012-13) and Cerci (2010-11 and 2014-15).

"We all have the need to be close to nature to experience its beauty, but nature has a dark side, one that many people have trouble recognizing or even acknowledging.

These people are drawn to nature because it allows them to reconnect to a feeling they can't get enough of—love, joy, and peace.

However, a lot of these people, for various reasons, can't seem to enjoy their lives.

Some may not be able to handle the daily pressures that are the hallmark of modern society, and they often end up being unable to see the beauty, joy, and peace they're looking for in life.

But, like many others who've never been able to feel these feelings before, you don't have to be an introvert to find happiness and peace. You just have to take action now to begin reconnecting with what nature has to offer.

Here's what to do to get back to being a nature lover.

1. Choose Your Nature

In my own personal experience, nature lovers have had an experience that goes along the lines of a ""reverse flashback,"" in which they recall the moments that were happiest and most fulfilling.

Some people recall a particular location or feeling of serenity"
"The New Orleans Saints' new defense is set to make its first appearance Sunday against the Oakland Raiders. The defense's performance against the Atlanta Falcons has raised eyebrows in New Orleans, with several observers questioning how well it can handle an elite passing offense like the one that's in place in Oakland.

With a first-team unit of linebackers and a secondary featuring a rookie, a third-year player and two more players on the practice squad, it's reasonable to assume the Saints defense is a work in progress. But even after three practices and three preseason games, the Saints' defense remains an unknown entity, a unit that needs a little more time to figure itself out before we see what they have.

In this installment of Around the NFL's series, we take a look at each player on the defense. We will start with the linebackers and move up to the secondary in order.

Defensive coordinator Rob Ryan is in a unique situation with the linebackers he's chosen to coach. On one hand, there's the talent the Saints have in the linebacker corps. On the other, the team is looking for some consistency after a strong rookie campaign from Keenan Lewis and a season that featured a lot of flashes, but nothing resembling a true breakout campaign from Craig"
"""You must not tell any other student what I do!"" I snapped back to reality, realizing the reason I was being so insistent about it was that the other students at this school knew all too well. I'd only told one other girl at my old school. And that girl had been one of the cheerleaders who'd had the nerve to try to steal the cheerleaders' hearts, which meant she'd have the attention of a bunch of girls who thought I was just being too much of a dork to notice their obvious love of my attention. I couldn't be so stupid as to think that my secret was safe in the hands of some girl who wouldn't know any better, though I had no doubt she would be just as willing as the other girls. I took a deep breath, trying to calm my raging heart and get myself back under control, then went to my desk and took out a pair of scissors, holding one end to my ear while the other went into the other's.

""No, you won't,"" I told her, reaching forward with both hands, gently pulling on her hair to make sure she could hear. I let the scissors slip from her hand as she stood, letting them slide out of her ear before she stumbled"

Cowan was the head coach for the under-19 South Africa side which played a series of international cricket between October 2005 and December 2006.

In an unrelated matter, he has also been charged with sexual abuse and aggravated rape against a 14-year-old female in 2008.

Ahead of the season three premiere, StarWars.com was on the set of The Clone Wars, a live action TV show based on the animated series. This year we've been introduced to some of the characters featured on Rebels including Rex, Chopper and the Jedi Knight Sabine, while a new trailer showed us a glimpse of Sabine and her friend Jyn Erso as they got to know each other in a cantina.

We also had the chance to see an early version of Sabine's costume which featured an extended jacket over a dark jacket which we will see worn on screen next season. Check it out:

"It's been a rough year for the Seattle Mariners, and one of the more notable losses in recent years came during a game on June 30. The team's starting pitcher, Hisashi Iwakuma, suffered an oblique injury during his start. After suffering through an abysmal outing, the Mariners had little choice but to turn to left-hander Hisashi Iwakuma for the final four innings.

With Iwakuma on the mound, the Mariners went on to defeat the Arizona Diamondbacks, 1-0, in the ninth inning to complete an epic comeback and end their seven-game losing streak.

""It was an epic effort from everybody. Hisashi is an extremely talented guy,"" Mariners manager Eric Wedge said of his team's hero. ""Hisashi's a good friend of mine and we had some really good conversations. It was good to see him do that, so I'm glad to have him on my team.

""That was an unbelievable game,"" he continued. ""There were times in the game that were incredible.""

Ahead of the game, Wedge said that his starting pitching rotation will remain the same. Iwakuma is set to pitch Sunday."
"""It's time for us to grow up."" That's the refrain we heard over and over again during this year's debate about the role of religion in politics. And while I agree that this country needs to evolve beyond our ""us versus them"" approach to politics, we're going to need a little more ""us"" and a little less ""them"" when it comes to how we deal with those with different beliefs.

Let me give you a couple of examples of how this could go down. Let's say there was a Republican president and a Democratic Congress, but Republicans and Democrats were both convinced that climate change is real. You can see this already in the Senate: there's an effort underway to defund the Environmental Protection Agency and, while Republicans in Congress don't seem to like that idea, the White House seems to think that they should. The president would be a bit more diplomatic: he'd say he thinks it's a serious issue that the government has an interest in addressing, and that he thinks the best way to do that is through scientific research. He might even be a little more honest, since he'd know that he'd have to give up on trying to block EPA action if he could no longer say that he thought the science was unsettled"
"The number of women who have reported they have been sexually assaulted while serving in the military has doubled to over 7,000 over the past six months, a new survey found.

The Military Sexual Trauma Study, or MSST, also revealed that almost three in 10 female veterans and more than one-quarter of male veterans reported being raped, physically abused, or forced to have sexual intercourse against their will.

""What is remarkable about this survey is the number of women who report having been raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers,"" said study lead author Dr. Margaret Hart, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

""I was surprised at how common that is among female veterans. And it is especially shocking among female veterans who have been deployed in combat. These are men who have put their lives at risk for others. This is the equivalent of a woman in her late 40s or early 50s serving on active duty and getting raped or sexually assaulted by a stranger.""

The findings come at a time of increasing attention and public scrutiny surrounding sexual assault and harassment within the military. Earlier this week, President-elect Donald Trump weighed in on the issue,"
"""You could look at this and see if he is going to be a very successful president in a few months, if not a few days, because we are going to be doing an end run around Congress,"" Paul told The Hill.

Paul has made similar statements about Obama before. The senator has criticized the administration's executive orders in the past and has pledged to do so in the future.

He made the same argument last year after a White House plan to grant temporary work authorization for children brought to the United States illegally as minors failed.

""We need to change our immigration policy, which is broken and needs to be fixed, not just talk about it and pass some executive order,"" Paul told the Washington Post in an interview. ""That is just an attempt to buy some time.""

""There will be no executive action in this area, that is true,"" White House spokesman Eric Schultz later added in a press briefing. ""There are going to be several steps taken that the president takes, starting today, that he is announcing, including that there are going to be consequences for the people who overstay their visa.... There is also a new way that you will be able to be legalized to become a U.S."
"""If the Trump Administration and the Senate go along with the bipartisan budget deal reached yesterday, the US government will run out of funding at the end of September and will not have sufficient funds to continue the essential services the nation needs. These essential services include critical programs that provide essential medical care and nutrition for the most vulnerable populations, including veterans, military families and the elderly.""

Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) today, warning them that if a government funding deal isn't passed, the government would run out of money on September 30 and may not be able to keep running at all. The letter also warned that any new deal must be bipartisan.

""It is critically important to keep our government running when the threat of a government shutdown is still on the horizon, so that we can continue to deliver the essential services the nation needs,"" they wrote. ""However, the recent budget deal between House and Senate negotiators falls short in meeting the need to address our country's fiscal challenges.

"BART passengers and those riding in shuttles were forced to contend with delays Wednesday night because of a train fire near the Coliseum station.

At least five people were sent to area hospitals as a result of the incident at the station at 7th and Mission streets. BART spokesman Jim Allison said no injuries were reported.

BART had not confirmed that the train involved in the incident had derailed but it had shuttles in service for people traveling in that direction, and some stations in both directions had to be closed to allow those trains to clear, according to BART officials.

""I've been on this system since 1988 and we've had some fire problems here in the past, but they've never been of the magnitude that they were tonight,"" BART spokeswoman Alicia Trost told KPIX-TV.

A spokesman for the Alameda County Fire Department told The Bay Citizen the train was parked near the Coliseum station. He said there were ""multiple injuries.""

Fire crews responded to the fire at 8:26 p.m., said Battalion Chief Tom Mott.

BART has been in contact with the fire department to get more information on the fire, and will work with the city of San Francisco to determine what the damage will"

"It is difficult to find a time where I have been more in the news in the last two years than with my efforts to stop the ""Moral Majority"" and its attempts to overturn the legalization of same-sex marriage in Maine.

While many have written about this campaign in great detail, the basic premise of the Maine effort has not been nearly so well documented. That is not to say I do not share my efforts in Maine with people and groups all across the nation and in Maine in particular. But the media attention, which is quite substantial in Maine, has focused on a single group – a very small, out of state group with an extremist agenda and an attempt to overturn a law passed overwhelmingly by the people.

For years the ""Moral Majority"" has been engaged in a nationwide effort to convince the American public that there are some very significant and unassailable facts in support of their beliefs – facts which, they claim, support their claim to the title of ""moral majority"". Their main line of attack has been against those who they believe hold the opposing opinion – the so called ""traditional family"" or the ""family values"" crowd. They have spent a great deal of energy on the radio and the TV stations and in newspapers and magazines trying"
"The Dangers of The 'Overturned' Bike Lane on East Washington Avenue

I've been following this issue of the ""Overturned Bike Lane"" (ODB) on East Washington Avenue in Brooklyn since the first story broke in November, but the controversy is getting louder. It appears the New York City DOT has backed down in a battle that's gone on for over a year now, but there's a bigger problem with this situation and it has nothing to do with bike lanes.

It has to do with a parking spot.

On Sunday, July 5, 2017, the ""Overturned"" bike lane was painted over on East Washington Avenue at Broadway. The paint was white on one side, green on the other and was meant to give way for the newly painted ""Downtown Brooklyn"" bike lane on Broadway, but that wasn't what happened.

This is what it looks like today. The paint on the left is the original ""Downtown Brooklyn"" bike lane painted green on one side. The paint on the right is the paint of the ""Overturned"" bike lane that has been painted white. (The photo above shows the lane painted white with the original painted green and the newly painted white).

"As you know, our primary goal at the time was to keep our budget low enough that we would be able to move to our dream house (which will be announced later this month) with enough funds to have an awesome dog. This goal has been a real struggle as it was quite easy to get in a situation where we didn't have enough funds for our dog, which is not at all the best feeling. We were hoping that our campaign would raise enough funds for the house and for our dog, but the fact is we just aren't in a position to be able to afford our dream house yet. We are in a situation where we're in a little over 30% of our funding goal. We don't really have an answer yet because we are in this position because we are raising funds to fund the house first, which we didn't do for this project.


If we had been able to get our dream house as we wanted before the end of the campaign, then we would be in a much better position to keep our dream dog and be able to spend all our time on the campaign, and then we'd be able to put some more time and money into the rest of the campaign and on our website and everything.

"The idea of having to move my wife to the other side of town is just terrifying. And when I read that it will only take an hour to do it, it seems impossible.

So I set off this weekend, packing my gear and the most precious things in the world, hoping I could somehow convince the owner of our little one-bedroom apartment to let me live in a small, three-bedroom townhouse a couple of miles away from home.

The whole idea of being forced to live on a different side of the city, in the suburbs, seems like something I just shouldn't do, even for a couple of weeks. And I was afraid.

I live in a tiny apartment. It's only for one person, but it's a nice little apartment and I get a lot of use out of it. It's small, and it's small and I need it, but I have never been a small person, so this whole thing seems terrifying.

"The story is told from a different angle. There's an ending that has a very clear conclusion and it's all that matters, not what the author tried to accomplish. There's also no sense that you've been dragged through this world, only that it exists and is a part of the universe you are part of. This book was so long I never knew where the end was, even though it ended so long ago.

In the end I think this is what's going to hurt me the most as a reader. The book is not a novel. It is a collection of stories that are told as you read along. The characters and plot are very thin, but there is something there that I feel like I got the whole picture and have never known what will happen. That is one thing I like about books: there's a complete story there that I just don't get and have to keep re-reading.


There was one scene in particular where the story took an unexpected turn. I never knew what was going on and when the story started again, the ending had a clear and distinct meaning, which was completely unexpected and surprising.

I also felt that I didn't learn everything. It took a little bit longer than I was hoping it"

For many Egyptians, ISIS's black banner hangs high on a tall building, the only evidence of a battle they say the extremist group won only through violence and coercion. But now the group, which is fighting to topple Egypt's military government, has claimed its first victory of the current conflict — in Cairo.

"Mumbai: India is looking at an average annual growth rate of 8.8 per cent to 11 per cent for the current financial year as the government keeps an eye on the impact of a potential rate cut in the US.

""India is growing at 7-8 per cent but is in the middle of a transition as it seeks to establish a sound policy framework. There is an expectation of a rate cut in the US but I think this is premature as there is a risk that it could lead to inflation and a tightening of financial conditions.

""A good example of a rate cut leading to inflation and a tightening of financial conditions is Japan and I do not see any prospects for this happening,"" said Abhijit Banerjee, senior economist at Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd.

Inflationary pressure could ease with an improvement in global economic growth and a pickup in private investment as a result of lower interest rates and better conditions for public and private spending.

India's economic growth was 8.8 per cent in 2016-17, slightly above the government's target of 8.5 per cent but well below the average rate of 10.8 per cent from 2004 to 2014.

On his Instagram page, President-elect Donald Trump announced his new business venture: Trump Tower Chicago. The project's website shows an exterior that looks more like a corporate headquarters than the headquarters of a private businessman, with an imposing glass-fronted tower, and a wide lobby filled with Trump's own branded furniture and jewelry. The site promises to create more than 200 jobs, including ""new jobs at Trump Tower.""

In a press release issued just minutes before Trump took the stage to accept the Republican Party's nomination, Trump described his project as an investment that will bring ""jobs of the future"" and a ""tremendous investment in our city."" The Trump Organization claims it is the only company to ever ""operate its own Tower"" and ""hold the exclusive right to the use of Trump's name.""

The US has vowed to ""destroy"" the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria after it declared a self-proclaimed caliphate across a large swathe of land in Iraq and Syria.

Mr Abbott said it would be a ""huge mistake"" for the US to support the terrorist group.

He told reporters: ""We are a country that stands for free speech and free societies.

""But we also need to be clear that Australia and the United States of America stand with our friends and our allies, against terrorist threats, against ISIL [Isis] and its supporters.""

"The current system of awarding a maximum of four state scholarships is outdated, the commission's report says. (Photo: File/The Tennessean)

The state is under increasing pressure to adopt a new scholarship system that is more competitive and is fair for both the state and students who seek the coveted award, according to the commission's latest report.

""It is critical to move our state's scholarship programs toward more merit-based funding and away from a system that awards the maximum scholarship available to an entire high school class, regardless of ability to pay,"" the report states. ""Our system has long been the target of critics, but our state's financial and academic challenges compel us to move toward more equitable funding for our students.""

The state is currently under an obligation to pay for every student who reaches a high school level who wants to pursue higher education. The commission recommended a change in the way Tennessee distributes scholarship funds from the current maximum of $8,000 for every four years. Instead, it suggested a cap of $15,000 per student to help make scholarships more accessible.

The report recommends a cap on state scholarships in excess of the cap for all public school districts. In the case of Nashville public schools, it would mean"

So said former Vice President Al Gore to The Washington Post in 2008, before the release of the documentary Inconvenient Truth. But, of course, that was then. And this is now. The world has changed.

For one, it has changed radically. We live in a time of rapid, technological change, from smartphones, to drones, to climate change. The climate has changed. And our planet is no longer as stable as it used to be. The question is: Is there enough of the world left? And how does climate change fit in to the rest of the equation?

It is an uncomfortable question, and one that the media, the climate change movement, and many environmental groups are still grappling with. So we asked climate experts for their perspective, as well as to weigh in on how climate change could play out on a day-to-day basis, from an environmental, political, and personal standpoint.

Climate change is a real issue that will only get worse as a result of greenhouse gas emissions. As climate scientist Jennifer Francis noted to the Post, the United States alone has already burned enough coal to ""burn a half a billion years,"""
"It is the duty of all government and law-enforcement officers, both police and soldiers, to protect life and property and to prosecute criminal activity.

There is no other country on the face of the earth, save only the Soviet Union, which places more confidence in the legality and efficacy of its law-enforcement officers and law-enforcing agencies than does Canada.

We all have the same obligations. It is the duty of all law-enforcement officers, both police and soldiers, both private and public, to protect life and property and to prosecute criminal activity.

Canada's approach is that the use of force, in all circumstances, is an exceptional remedy, an emergency measure and should only be resorted to as an absolute last resort.

This approach has been well demonstrated by Canada over many decades. The most obvious examples are the RCMP's use of lethal force, which was so excessive, in some instances, that it constituted torture.

There has also been a consistent history of excessive use of force by police, especially when it is in response to unlawful acts, which, of course, should never be the case.

"A federal appeals court in Boston said a judge must dismiss an antitrust lawsuit brought against Google and seven other technology companies.

In its decision, the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals said Judge Richard Posner was ""entirely correct"" that a class of Google and other technology companies has been excluded from the lawsuit, known as ""Google Wallet.""

Google and the other defendants had been accused of colluding to give consumers poor value for their money because Google Wallet was only available at participating ATMs.

Judge Posner ruled that the case could not proceed because the plaintiffs lacked a sufficient evidence to show that a conspiracy existed and because there was insufficient proof of a direct threat to competition.

The description goes on to state that ""The hero, A.K, sets out on a journey to discover the origins of his mother, who mysteriously disappears, and unravel the secrets of Aquan.

"The ""We Can Do It"" slogan for the U.S. Department of Defense has become the unofficial mantra for America's military, as it has been repeatedly cited in every new national security announcement, as well as by presidential candidates in both parties. The motto, first introduced by President Harry S. Truman, is the cornerstone of U.S. strategy. But can we really do it?

The question of whether we can or should do more in the face of an international security crisis has long been the subject of heated debate, particularly among American political and military elites, with both sides offering different solutions and perspectives on what ""America should be doing."" In recent years, this debate has grown louder. The Iraq and Afghanistan wars are coming to an end, and a new round of American military operations will commence soon after.

What the U.S. can do in response to these events, or if there are other actions that the United States should be taking in order to prepare itself for future threats, is of vital importance. It is not hard to understand why: the international situation today is not a situation that will be resolved in the short term, nor is it one that the U.S. is capable of handling by itself.

"In this article we will discuss how to create a custom adapter to convert a json string to an sql query string and back. This article was originally published at the SQLAlchemy Tutorials.

JSON and SQL

One of the main goals of developing applications that communicate with the outside world is to have data in JSON form.

As of now, it's a relatively common practice to store the data as a series of rows, with the columns containing a simple text representation. For example, imagine that the following database schema represents a table containing information about users.

CREATE TABLE users ( id int not null auto_increment, email string not null, username text NOT NULL, first_name text, last_name text );

A developer might decide to build the following app, where each user is represented as an instance of a user model:

defmodule User do @behaviour Schema.Model use Ecto.Relation import Ecto.Schema, :model alias UserEcto end @doc """""" Create an instance of the model, e.g.: User.create(:email) """""" def create(email) do users = User.all.filter do |u| u.email =="

Let's first have a look at what a normal folder in a Windows system looks like. You will notice that I have an image file, an mp3 file and some videos in that folder. So that means the folder contains all the files that I have in my PC and is available to all the people I want to share them with.

In the Windows File Explorer there are various folders, and the only reason to have all of those folders open is that it's much easier for you to locate all of them than to create and close a few files to view all the files in them. In addition there are sub folders (which is an acronym for'subfolders inside a folder'), these are named in order to give them a hierarchical structure and the more subfolders you have, the easier it will be for you to locate your files.

"Marijuana and alcohol can both make people feel great. And alcohol has been proven to reduce pain. So, why doesn't it do that with painkillers?

We recently took a closer look at why that's not the case with opioids like morphine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, oxymorphone and others. And, as a result of our investigation, we've created this infographic, showing you how different kinds of alcohol work with the drugs in a unique way to relieve pain.

Opioid painkillers kill about 100 people per day

The average daily consumption of opioids by adults ages 19 to 64 is 2,800 mg.

One-fifth of all painkillers consumed by patients in the United States are for acute pain (the worst kind, and most severe pain), with another 35 percent of people who get prescribed opioids taking them for chronic pain, or pain that persists longer than two weeks.

Nearly two-thirds of patients on opioids who started with less than two weeks of chronic pain are continuing to get opioids for pain longer than a year, and 40 percent are still getting them after 12 months"

The legislation would require the state Department of Health to issue an advisory on fetal age and to review existing regulations for an exemption for physicians to perform abortions in cases of rape or incest.

The bill now moves to the House for consideration, where it's expected to be approved by a vote of 75-25. The state's Senate will have the final vote.

In addition to requiring abortions at 12 weeks or beyond, the legislation would ban abortions at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and beyond.

"A few months back I started an Instagram account just so that I could get some kind of idea about my audience, but it has become a very successful platform and it is growing even more! So far, it's getting me tons of traffic to my blog and even getting me some visitors from Reddit, so it is a great way for me to build a following. I've always been a pretty shy person and this social network is just another way for me to open up more to others, but also get my messages out there and find some new people that are into what I am. I just thought it would be interesting to show a little bit about me and show my Instagram feed!

Here I am in my backyard with my dog and a few of the trees that I enjoy planting, as well as my other pets that live at home!"
"In the aftermath of a massive power outage on Christmas Day that shut down New York City for several hours and shuttered New Jersey Transit's system, a former NJ Transit employee filed a class-action lawsuit Wednesday against the railroad that controls the New York and New Jersey subway and the Port Authority, the New Jersey agency that owns it.

The suit names the two entities, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state's largest public agency, as well as four other parties.

The former employee, Michael Leitner, a former deputy chief of maintenance and engineering at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, says the railroad was responsible for the power failure and should have installed new equipment.

He filed the suit on behalf of himself, all current and former employees at M.T.A. who had access to the New York-New Jersey subway system on Christmas Day. Leitner was an assistant general manager.

A spokesman for M.T.A. and a Port Authority spokeswoman did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday."
"As we've all probably seen or heard by now, a former Texas Rangers scout who is facing charges of raping a child and possession of child pornography has pleaded guilty to two counts of first-degree sexual assault.

In his guilty plea, the former Rangers scout admitted to having sexual relations with a child younger than 17. He is expected to receive a sentence of six months to four years. He faces a minimum of a 20-year sentence on the charges, but may not serve as much time if he is able to complete the treatment and probation that comes with his plea.

As we've already learned, this was not an isolated incident. He has had many brushes with the law over the course of his career and the Texas Rangers, the organization that he's played for for the past 16 years, did little to stop his activities. In fact, they did nothing.

According to an ESPN.com article that broke the news of his guilty plea, he had previously been fired by the Texas Rangers. The Rangers also fired the former scouting director, who had worked with the organization since 2010, in 2010, and he was suspended without pay after a 2014 incident involving the alleged rape.

As reported by ESPN, the Rangers hired a law firm in"

"This week the International Business Times reports that the NSA is using an XKeyscore database containing records of phone calls from around the world. This database can be searched by any government, not just by the NSA.

The report states, ""NSA documents describe how XKeyscore enables analysts to search through vast databases of Internet and phone metadata in real-time."" The database also collects Internet metadata and calls made by Verizon, Sprint and AT&T subscribers. The database is being used in conjunction with a previously secret NSA surveillance program called PRISM, which collects data from private companies such as Google and Yahoo, but it does not involve the NSA directly. The database is said to have ""almost unlimited"" amounts of information, which is presumably being stored.

XKeyscore has been used since 2008 in the intelligence agencies of many countries, including Britain and France, which were reportedly concerned about possible terrorist activity after the September 11th attacks in the U.S. However, the report says, the NSA was also using XKeyscore ""in an aggressive and largely unaccountable fashion, collecting, storing and searching vast quantities of Internet metadata"" including information such as websites visited by individuals, phone calls and email addresses, and Internet protocols.

"A New Orleans Police Department sergeant, accused of being one of the ringleaders of the violent robbery that nearly destroyed the neighborhood and caused an explosion of fear in a black community, is expected to be fired after an arbitrator's ruling last week.

Officer Scott Miller has been charged with the second degree felony of using a gun during a robbery in a case that sparked widespread concern from civil rights and police watchdogs about whether he and two other officers would be held accountable for the alleged gang assault on a man on a dark street in a mostly white part of the city.

On Sept. 5, 2011, three black men, ages 22, 26 and 32, were in an argument in a car near the corner of Napoleon Avenue and East 12th Street in Gentilly when three white men, ages 29, 39 and 41, walked up, according to a complaint filed against the four men in federal court in January 2012. One of the black men had a gun. The others took their guns and took the two young men to the house across the street and assaulted them with the three men in the car.

One of the white men told police that he and his friends, including Officer Miller, ""got their asses beat up and had guns pulled on"

After going ahead by 16 early in the third quarter, Washington blew it wide open on the road and ultimately fell. This game should have been a win, but instead, the Wizards ended up getting outscored by 15 and it cost them dearly.

"The House Intelligence Committee's ranking Democrat said in a letter Wednesday that President Trump's tweet that President Barack Obama ""wiretapped"" him last year is an effort to ""politicize an issue"" by the White House.

""I strongly urge you to take a stand against these attempts by the White House and President Trump to undermine the integrity of the congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election,"" Rep. Adam Schiff said in his letter to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes.

The White House and the president have said for weeks that Mr. Trump has no evidence of surveillance or surveillance-related efforts. Mr. Trump made his explosive claim at a White House event in January and has since repeated it repeatedly, most recently on Twitter Tuesday.

The House Intelligence Committee is looking into the Trump campaign's contacts with Russia. But it also is investigating how and why the Obama administration, through Mr. Trump, sought to retaliate against Russia for interfering with the U.S. presidential election.

The intelligence committees in the Senate and the House of Representatives have been looking into that matter for months.

"B.A.P is known as ""B.A.P to the Extreme,"" but the members themselves don't necessarily agree.

When it comes to B.A.P's image, it seems to be the one constant that's held up all throughout. But how exactly do the group's members feel about that label?

During the latest episode of 'Inkigayo' with 'Show Champion,' B.A.P member Jongup told host JTBC that the group feels it's hard to get out of the B.A.P name because they have to put up with constant questions about whether or not the group will disband.

He said, ""When I think of B.A.P, I think of that image of that image that you saw when you first watched us. There were those that loved us and those who hated us and everyone was divided.""

""I'm just one of those people who likes to think we're a band that is going to be around for a while.""

When JTBC asked the members to talk about the group's current image, Jongup said, ""There is that image that I like, and that is B.A.P. that we"

The F.B.I. says Edward Snowden stole and provided thousands of classified documents to a Hong Kong journalist that were passed to journalists from Glenn Greenwald, a Guardian reporter. Mr. Greenwald reported the news on the Snowden disclosures in early June, and the Guardian has continued reporting the story, as have other outlets, including The New York Times, in recent days.

"Rams and Rams and Rams.

As I've been telling my readers for quite some time, there's been an undercurrent of ""Rams vs. Rams"" talk over the years, mostly because the Rams haven't always won when they're on the other side of the division, or they haven't won when they're playing in Los Angeles.

Last season, for example, the Rams beat the Chiefs on the road and then went on a nine-game winning streak that ended up losing them the NFC West title. They did have the division lead all along.

This year, they're the No. 1 seed. So it's no longer the same. It's the first time since 2003 that they haven't been in first place at the start of the season, but it's a different situation with a new opponent in the way of their quest to reach the playoffs for the third consecutive season.

I was able to chat with Rams linebacker Jo-Lonn Dunbar this week and he mentioned a few other reasons why they've won games on the road:

""It's kind of the way the NFL is set up now,"" he said. ""We don't play anybody. It's an easier way for us."
"In a move to help prevent fraudsters, a group of small businesses have signed up to join a program that aims to track the sale and use of their goods online. The initiative, launched by the National Retail Federation and the Federal Trade Commission, aims to identify shoppers who have bought items that appear to be stolen and who then resell them to retailers at inflated prices.

""In the case of stolen merchandise, this means we can trace it back to the actual retail seller, which makes it more likely the consumer will receive a refund, or in some cases even be held liable,"" says Matthew Kutz, vice president and chief compliance counsel of the National Retail Federation, a trade organization representing nearly 2,500 small and independent businesses. ""By tracking these items and providing information to consumers and merchants alike, we can ensure the safety of the products being purchased, while still providing the convenience that comes with shopping online.""

The program will allow shoppers to log onto an online platform, such as Ebay or Amazon.com, and search for items they are considering buying, then download an application from the site to their cell phones to identify their purchase, according to an FAQ provided by the FTC.

Once a shopper's application has been processed, it will"
"It is possible for a woman to become pregnant with two babies in one pregnancy, if one of them is stillborn or miscarries. It is called multiple pregnancy. This can be caused by an abnormality in a cell of the egg (ovum), an infection (chicken pox or meningitis) or an infection or birth defect that affects a developing embryo (anencephaly, trisomy 21, Edwards Sars) in the womb.

There are no medical treatments available that can be used to help the pregnancy progress, other than trying again to become pregnant. There may also be a chance of miscarriage during the first pregnancy if the mother was previously pregnant and has not had any miscarriages in the last 10 years.

What is multiple pregnancy?

When a fertilised egg has implanted itself into a womb of a pregnant woman, there may be up to three possible ways to deliver that fertilised egg to the uterus:

the egg can be passed along the Fallopian tubes to the womb

the fertilised egg can implant itself into a lining of the womb, called a chorionic villous tissue (CMTV)

"In a recent article by a University of Washington researcher, she discusses a new study of a common skin cancer. The researcher discovered a possible link between sun exposure and skin cancer in women and their babies, especially if they had a history of exposure to sunlight before their first child was born.

In the study, published in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology, researchers at the University of Washington compared the melanoma rate in 1,300 mothers who were pregnant and those who were not in their second, third, and fourth pregnancy, with that of their babies at one, two, four, six, eight, 10, and 12 months. The mothers were mostly Caucasian, and about a quarter were of Hispanic heritage. The babies' mothers also had some history of sun exposure in the womb, although not as much as the moms. The researchers also examined whether mothers had an increased risk of having an increased rate of melanoma for each additional hour they spent outside in the summer, from nine months to three years.

The results were pretty alarming, as they revealed a 12.2 percent increase in melanoma risk per hour spent outside in the summer, or an average increase of five to eight cancers per 100 women. The study also showed an average increase in cancer risk"

"It was only a few years ago that a young couple named Evan and Jessica, who are in the process of getting married, had no idea that their relationship could potentially destroy the world.

The couple's plans to tie the knot at the end of March have been thwarted by the US government. According to a report by the Inquisitr, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is demanding that they hand over a list of every person they have communicated with via their website.

In addition to their website, which allows anyone to become an anonymous member of the wedding registry, the couple has been listed as members on numerous websites and Facebook groups. In addition to being able to post pictures, they were able to comment and post updates on each other's status updates.

While some of their comments could have been harmless, it wasn't long before they crossed the line into something far worse. The couple had a daughter with their marriage and were expecting her to join them. As such, they were happy to take care of the baby's needs and feed her whenever they needed to. However, this changed once they learned of a website they used to help pay for things that weren't even covered by their health insurance.

A major point of emphasis for the 2014-15 campaign has been to continue to increase the team's exposure, particularly to younger audiences, and this year they are targeting young male viewers.

The team, which is headed by the former Chelsea goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon, will host the UEFA Champions League Round of 16 against Liverpool, on Thursday, February 15 at 19.00 CET (20.00 CET in London), at the San Siro, which was built for football, not opera, but that did not prevent it from becoming one of the most expensive tickets ever for a European soccer match.

It is estimated that the event could have brought €4.1 million in revenue.

"It is one thing for an artist to take on an important role, or a cause, and another thing to turn out an art piece that has the power to influence others in a profound way.

For those reasons, we have to be very careful when discussing the controversial artwork by artist Jamie McKelvie that appears on the back of a United States banknote.

McKelvie was born and raised in Toronto. As a young person, McKelvie spent a lot of time on the street, spending much of his time on the sidewalks or the sidewalks around Toronto.

""It's always been my passion,"" McKelvie told CTV News Toronto in a telephone interview on Friday.

In 2007, McKelvie had a conversation with the U.S. bank note designer that inspired him to create a piece that he would ultimately put on a U.S. banknote.

The idea started as a conversation about the artist's life as an artist in the street, as McKelvie says that it is always about the artist in the street.

"It was an ugly and bloody night at a prison in the city of Volgograd when two convicts fought their way into the courtyard of the building and began firing into the courtyard of the nearby school.

According to Russian state TV, the inmates of the facility in the southern Russian city were firing a ""heavy automatic rifle,"" with ""great precision,"" and that they had been ""working in coordination"" with other inmates who were shooting ""into the building.""

It is the latest incident involving prison inmates in the region in recent weeks. In June, an inmate of the same facility opened fire at another school. In July, an inmate in a prison in Chelyabinsk Region opened fire at the main street of Chelyabinsk. In the most recent case, however, the inmate opened fire from inside a prison in the Volgograd Region, killing one inmate.

A police officer and a person who witnessed the fight told Russia's TV channel Zvezda that the convicts who attacked the school and school grounds had come to the prison after killing one other prisoner at a prison nearby. They reportedly told the officers they were trying to escape, but were stopped when one of the prison guards returned fire and killed one of the prisoners,"

The National Capital Region Economic Development Strategy will create new jobs, enhance economic prosperity and strengthen the quality of life in the NCC over the long-term, said the department in its report.

The report outlines three major pillars for the NCC and a total of $13.2 billion of federal investments. The NCC has seen significant investment over the past two decades and the new plan aims to maintain and improve this level of support, the department said in a statement.

The first pillar focuses on supporting job creation in the region by focusing on three major economic growth sectors: business services, health care and technology. The NCC has been recognized by Statistics Canada for the fastest economic growth of the past 25 years.

The second pillar will be focused on boosting innovation and development in the NCC, particularly in health care, science and technology.

"A federal judge on Wednesday rejected a challenge from the federal government to a law allowing transgender people to change their sex-reassignment surgeries to gender markers that match their identity, making good on President Barack Obama's decision last summer to keep the change from taking effect.

In the decision, US District Judge Reed O'Connor said that the government, the plaintiffs, the Obama administration and the US government were in agreement that the surgery change would ""have no practical effect,"" as the law was already on the books and no changes would have to be made to the law.

O'Connor did allow some minor exemptions to the surgery law. It allows people who are facing ""imminent"" risk of suicide, ""in danger of death,"" who are being denied health care because they're transgender, and others. The judge did not rule on those exemptions.

""The government has shown that this is a narrow category of cases, and that there's no danger of creating an unworkable or unworkable scheme for this statute,"" said Judge O'Connor. ""That's good for everybody.""

"MADRID, Spain -- A man suspected of plotting to carry out a bomb attack in a Barcelona concert hall on New Year's Day was shot and killed by police.

A man in his thirties who had a permit to carry out his attack was shot by police, authorities said, though he had no explosives in the bag he carried into the venue, according to a statement released late Saturday night. The man had not been identified.

A bomb disposal robot was used to check the man's bag before officers killed him, a spokeswoman for the regional government said. The incident occurred during a police operation to find the attacker, who had reportedly planned to use the bag as a suicide vest.

The attack, in which a van plowed through a crowd, injuring more than 150 people, occurred on Barcelona's busiest thoroughfare, Las Ramblas, on the evening of Thursday, Dec. 13, around midnight local time, shortly before a rock concert was about to start. The attack came a few hours before a terror threat against Barcelona was lifted after an overnight investigation by security agencies, officials said.

"In an article written for the Journal of Applied Psychology in 1959, psychiatrist Charles Seife reported a remarkable experiment on children's memories.

The children had to identify and recall a series of objects and to state which was first and which was second in sequence. Afterward, Seife and his colleagues quizzed the children. When it came to identifying which item had come before the other, Seife said that the children could recall it more easily, and in this way they learned the order in which objects were placed.

The children were able to learn to identify objects and in doing so they learned how they had been placed. In this experiment, Seife was attempting to show that memory is a cognitive process rather than an emotional process. He also wanted to show that the brain works best in the presence of order.

The research is remarkable in light of modern research, which is now beginning to demonstrate that our memories are not formed in a purely cognitive way. Our brains work better in the presence of order.

This new research, by a team of psychologists from the University of Warwick and University College London, suggests that order may be an essential part of our memory system and may also be related to how well we learn new things.

"In a major win for women in the military, Congress passed the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act on Friday, in a move that could prevent domestic abuse from being dismissed as ""military culture."" The bill also sets in place new procedures to adjudicate sexual assaults and helps improve access to services for survivors.

The new legislation, the VAWA Reauthorization Act, is an important step for the nation's largest victims' advocacy organization, the National Network to End Domestic Violence (NNEDV), and for victims who have long been unable to seek help. It ensures that those in the armed forces can get help from their chain of command in instances of domestic violence and sexual assault, while protecting military personnel and veterans who might not be able to afford legal assistance or counseling.

The VAWA Act was enacted in 1994 with the aim of helping survivors of domestic abuse. But for victims, the reauthorization bill does much more, providing crucial resources and services to those in the military who may be in need of it. It will ensure that those who experience abuse receive the same care they receive when on active duty and for that matter when off of base. It also helps protect veterans and those who serve on active duty.

"MADRID (AP) — A Spanish court has banned an atheist organization that describes itself as an international human rights organization and calls itself the Spanish branch of the European Humanist Association.

The Spanish government banned the Catalan branch of the Humanist Association in November. It was the first time a national government in Spain had banned a humanist organization. The association, based in the city of Valladolid in southern Spain, said the court order means it can't help the thousands of Spanish prisoners serving lengthy prison sentences.

The Humanist Association, a national umbrella group in Spain that works for human rights, had sued Spain's National Court over a previous ruling banning it as an extremist group. It has a membership of about 3,000.

"RENO, Nev. - The Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) announced a change in the license plates issued to a woman who has a felony conviction in Arizona for impersonating an officer.

The DMV says that since her Arizona conviction is considered a ""serious criminal offense"" that warrants the renewal of her license plates, her new plates will reflect ""felony impersonation,"" according to a press release.

The Arizona conviction was a misdemeanor. The change to the plate in Nevada was a felony conviction that could be used against her if she attempted to re-apply.

""We recognize the challenges that Ms. Stewart faced in obtaining her driver license plate. Her felony conviction in Arizona should be a factor considered when determining whether she should be allowed to obtain her plates in Nevada,"" said DMV spokeswoman Nicole Aiken in a statement. ""Ms. Stewart was issued the felony impersonation plate by the DMV and her felony conviction was a serious criminal offense that was considered at the time of the license plate issuance.""

The DMV said it has been working to update the state's photo license plates.

The Arizona DMV did not return a call from KRQE News 13.

A 24-year-old man is charged with:

Four counts of armed robbery,

Two counts of carrying a concealed weapon, and

Two counts of breach of recognizance.

The 24-year-old is accused of robbing two people around 6:30 a.m. at the corner of 112th Street and 87 Avenue, and stealing their cellphones and $150 cash.

"Bees and honeybees have long been used for a variety of purposes. However, there have been many issues in recent years with their safety, such as colony collapse disorder (CCD), pesticides, and lack of food for their bees. Now, new research indicates that honeybees could have the potential to solve the issue of food for humans and bees by consuming plants instead.

According to researchers, it is believed that honeybees can consume more than 75% of the food in a field, making them the largest bee of their species. As the bees consume plant materials, it reduces the need for pollination for the plants, thereby making the food source for bees more plentiful and available to the plants.

""The bees consume about 50% of the edible biomass of the plants and can be regarded as the main driver of food availability to the plant community. In our experiments with the bees we showed that bees are able to digest plant parts. For instance, we have demonstrated that honeybees are able to digest leaves of a common species and their leaves are very rich in phenolic compounds. These compounds can have many biological activities that have a role in health. It has been known that plants with a higher proportion of leaves and flowers with phenolics are better in terms"

"It was just a matter of time until someone else took on the world of high-end home electronics with the help of Kickstarter. That time has come. The creators of a crowdfunding campaign for a $1,300 stereo amp, designed for home-theater speakers, have finally started shipping. The result, a high-powered and relatively small audio amp with a stylish design and a very impressive list of features.

The $1,300 system comes from a team that has previously produced high-quality speakers under their own name. It has been under development since February and it is expected to start shipping this month, the same week as the campaign's $250,000 funding goal.

The Kickstarter campaign has a number of unique features, including the ability to pair it with the popular Amazon Echo or Apple TV to make it easier to control and enjoy your home entertainment system. You also have the ability to stream audio through Bluetooth. And with the new ability to control multiple audio sources, the device has the potential to do some serious mixing.

"The head of a global bitcoin mining pool, whose software helped generate more than a million bitcoins in one day, says his operation was targeted by a malicious attack, with some bitcoins stolen from his account.

Bitcoin miners use computer algorithms to verify the authenticity of bitcoins created through a process known as mining.

Miner Luke-Jr's BitClub Network reported its machines were ""hijacked"" on August 18. ""We're trying to work through what happened and understand the circumstances that lead us here,"" he told CNNMoney.

"A federal appeals court ruled Tuesday that President Obama's immigration program cannot be shut down in a dispute between Arizona and U.S. Border Patrol.

In a 6-3 decision, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Arizona must pay $2.5 million in costs for the operation of the 287(g) program.

The program has allowed Arizona and other border states to check the immigration status of individuals stopped along the border and notify the Department of Homeland Security when it's in their best interests to take action.

Arizona argued the program cost the state millions in lost revenue. The Obama administration says the program has reduced apprehensions of illegal border-crossers.

""It is undisputed that the government has achieved its policy goals, that its costs to Arizona are reasonable in light of those goals and the state's limited ability to bear those costs,"" Judge Stephen Reinhardt wrote in Tuesday's ruling. ""In this respect, the record in this case supports our conclusion that the Government's burden in this case is heavy and that it may be rebated in part through reimbursement.""

[Warning: This story contains spoilers from Wednesday's ""The Originals.""]

If you want a series of interconnected and interconnected series that spans time and space, you need a serial killer. And if you're not going to do the serial killer thing, you need a witch.

For The CW, those are the ingredients in ""The Vampire Diaries,"" the new show from executive producers Julie Plec (""Supernatural,"" ""Cougar Town"") and Ian Brennan (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer""). It's a spin-off that is part ""The 100,"" part ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" — the latter because its first episode features an episode in which the first vampire to bite is also a witch, which is why it's called ""Witch Wars.""

Plec says that the spinoff has been in development for years — well before Plec herself got the call to become ""The Vampire Diaries' showrunner,"" and the network wasn't sure what it had in store when she was hired in November to take over from Diane Ruggiero-"
"A recent report published in The Lancet medical journal concluded that ""in the last 50 years the percentage of women of reproductive age with diabetes in developing countries has nearly doubled."" This increase, researchers believe, is the result of rising consumption of sugar, especially sugar in beverages and food, and the rising incidence of diabetes in these countries.

""Our data suggests that the health benefits of restricting sugar intake for the prevention and control of diabetes have been largely neglected,"" lead study author Dr. David Stare of the University of Auckland in New Zealand and the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden told The Huffington Post. ""However, this has led to the growing consumption of sugar and high-glycemic food.

The report, entitled ""Diabetes, the New Silent Killer,"" is part of the international Lancet Countdown Project, a project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation aimed at determining how to prevent and cure diabetes worldwide. Researchers at the Karolinska Institutet have been tracking diabetes and other conditions that can lead to a variety of serious illnesses, such as heart disease, cancer, stroke and respiratory illnesses, since 1998. The report, published this week, examined data from 1.1 billion adults and 3.5 million children worldwide from 1996-"
"In this paper we report on a study which provides new evidence on the influence of the natural environment on human cognition and behavior. It was found that, as predicted by environmentalism, a human infant exposed to an environmental noise at 1–6 months of age (a noisy home) was more susceptible to a later increase in the degree of impulsivity than a human infant not exposed to any noise (no-noise home). However, a child's susceptibility to noise did not depend on whether it lived in the countryside or in an urban area.

"""When a person who's in charge of the environment for a big corporation makes a public comment, and he's trying to put lipstick on a pig, people will say that he's making a lot of noise for nothing,"" says Steve Scholz, an environmental scientist who specializes in energy.

But, says Scholz, ""There are very few scientists who really are trying to put lipstick on a pig. And, frankly, the reason we don't know the impact of the stuff we're doing is that there aren't many of us trying.""

That may be changing. In recent years, the number of environmental scientists specializing in climate change and the environment has more than doubled, from less than 3,000 in 2005 to nearly 11,000, according to a new report by the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), an international non-profit.

"It was a case of a man, a woman and a baby, but the man and his child are alive, the woman's life is not in danger and police are treating the incident as a prank, the child is safe, police said.

The child was taken to Children's Hospital for an evaluation. Police are not treating it as a kidnapping.

The child, whose gender has not been released, is 2 months old and the mother, whose identity is also being withheld, was taken to Children's Hospital after a 911 caller said the child had been snatched by a man.

""At this point we have not had any indication from the mother that she was in any way, shape, or form threatened,"" said Capt. Robert McCausland of the Monroe Police Department.

McCausland said he has never seen anything like the situation, where the child was taken by the woman and a man who was believed to be in the apartment.

"A little-noticed report released earlier this week shows the number of people working at federal, state, and local government is down from a post-recession peak in early 2009, according to a new analysis of federal data by The Huffington Post.

The analysis shows that from June 2009 through April 2014, there was an overall increase of 5.5 percent in the total number of government workers in the United States -- even as the unemployment rate plummeted from 9.0 percent in May 2009 to 6.2 percent in March 2014.

That number represents about half the increase from a year earlier and represents a major setback for the president and his allies on the campaign trail. Obama has been promising to cut federal spending as a way of stimulating the economy since he took office, and his supporters have cited this decrease as proof he is delivering.

But the number of government workers actually fell by 4.6 percent -- a number that has remained unchanged since June 2009. And in a further indication of how little of the economic recovery the administration and Democrats are able to point to as a victory, the number of government jobs that paid a wage of less than $39,600 (adjusted for inflation) has declined by 7.1 percent.

Global Warming Alarmism: It's Real

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released their Fifth Assessment Report on November 28th. In that report they confirmed what most people have known all along. It's global warming. It's a massive problem with very little we can do about it. The only hope to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to make the entire economy carbon-neutral. This would reduce CO2 emissions to the point of making the entire atmosphere inhospitable to human life. It is the only way we can save the planet and keep ourselves from getting cooked.

""A better future depends on a stable climate. But climate change is real, and it's happening right now, with effects you can feel.""

"Risk and return are important terms in financial terms, especially in the investment industry, but they are often misused and misused to the extreme. This can result in investors paying higher and higher rates for less and less. The key is to use a risk management framework when choosing your investment vehicle and understanding how that risks can be minimized and, at the same time, capital gains should be minimized.

When an investor makes a risk decision, it is often not so much about the risks and potential outcomes as much as the costs of risk and potential returns. An investment will typically have multiple levels of risks and, therefore, investors can use a variety of risk management strategies. For example, in the example of buying an investment, there may be many possible outcomes such as a gain or loss.

Risks

One risk to be aware of when deciding which investments are worthwhile to buy or sell is the potential for the investor to lose their entire investment. An investment will be riskier than cash in a portfolio or in the bank if it has a greater than zero potential to lose all the money.

There are several risk management strategies to minimize risk in the portfolio and ensure a positive return for investors.

And I can't wait for our customers to try this amazing technology for the first time,"" said Richard Marks, Oculus VP of Product Development and Head of the VR Group.

The company revealed a few new details about its virtual reality hardware, including its head-mounted displays (HMD), Touch, and motion controllers. The Touch, the first of its kind in the market, will be released to the public this spring and is set to ship with a price tag of $199 USD.

In order to make the Touch the most immersive device, Oculus is focusing on bringing out a variety of different technologies in the upcoming year, such as high resolution displays and head mounted displays. According to the company, the new display is one of its most important innovations, since it allows the user to experience the content from the very moment he/she touches the Touch.

""It's one thing to try out the experience. It's another thing entirely to have it on a display that allows you to be completely immersed in a game world,"" said Michael Antonov, CEO and Co-founder of Oculus."

"Beset by scandals and lawsuits, the Florida Democratic Party's once-powerful and respected chairman resigned earlier this week, amid the discovery of emails suggesting he helped Hillary Clinton get paid.

Chairman Andrew Weinstein, who has led the Florida party since 2007, said his resignation was effective immediately, and the Florida Democratic Party would be headed by an interim chairwoman until a permanent replacement could be named.

In a statement released Monday evening, Weinstein said he and the Florida Democratic Party board ""reached an impasse in the past few weeks that made it impossible to move forward together."" He said he believes his resignation will bring an end to the ""circus that has surrounded this issue,"" adding:

The past week has brought forth many distractions, and I cannot continue as Chairman, given the gravity and complexity of these issues, at this time, without sacrificing the best interests of the Florida Democratic Party. The Board and I believe that our shared mission as party leaders and leaders in the state of Florida will continue in a different, better and stronger way, guided by the highest ideals of our party, and I will remain fully engaged as the interim Chairman.

In a statement issued late Monday afternoon, the Florida Democratic Party called the resignation a ""mutually"
"""What can we do for you? It's been a long day!""

That's what I'm going to say to every customer I encounter while working as a hair stylist at The Spa, a new restaurant that is set to open next year on West 22nd Street. The idea for the restaurant came to my friends, Brian and Lisa, at an all-ages bar on the Lower East Side in April 2012. It was an intimate spot where people were known to take a nap in the back while they enjoyed their cocktails, and they liked the idea of a restaurant that offered the kind of intimate and personal service that they liked.

The idea was that if The Spa could operate the way The Lounge and the Blackstone Lounge, two other New York City bars, have done in the past, they might be able to bring something special to New York City. That's not a completely new idea in the bar and restaurant business; I think that a lot of the success of restaurants like Craftsman and Ciroc was predicated on the fact that their owners believed that the customers they attracted were looking for that kind of service. I'm not sure what the success of that concept has meant for New York City bars and restaurants in general. I don"
"AUSTIN (KXAN) -- A bill that would create a special police unit that can confiscate firearms in a domestic violence incident passed its second reading in the House on Wednesday, sending the bill to the Senate for further consideration.

The House Criminal Jurisprudence Committee unanimously passed House Bill 2956 by an 8-1 vote on Wednesday, after a debate that included a number of speakers who said it is critical to keep guns away from people who might abuse others.

""What this bill does is it makes it much, much easier to seize weapons, which in turn makes it a lot easier to arrest those who do this to people who don't deserve to be abused,"" said State Rep. Senfronia Thompson, R-Houston. ""There are some situations that are so horrible, I mean, we can't have a gun in a domestic situation and there is a real concern about that, because there's just no reason why somebody should be abusing anybody with a firearm.""

However, most people don't take the time to take care of their online relationships. The people who do take the time to manage their Facebook and Instagram accounts, will find that their lives will be enhanced in more than one way. Here are ten benefits you will be getting if you start to manage your online relationships.

You will have more fun with friends

If you are the kind of person who wants to hang out with your friends but not on Facebook or Twitter, then you can stop right there. Facebook is all about people wanting to talk to you. Sure, they will still have fun chatting with you and sharing some laughs, but the people they talk to will not have any of the same opportunities. As soon as you post something online, your friends have no time to reply and even if you are having a conversation, they may not have a chance to reply either. With Facebook, you are constantly competing to have the best, and you have no time to focus on others. With Instagram, your friends can easily message you with any photos that they may be interested in"

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), as well as the NAACP, the American Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA) and many other organizations, has been filing lawsuits and public relations campaigns against the immigration detention center in Dilley, Texas.

This is because of what happened last October, when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers released a group of illegal aliens into a dilapidated apartment building, causing an explosion. One person died, and over thirty people were injured, including several who suffered serious burns.

According to a local newspaper report:

""It was an accident. No one intended to burn the building down. I was inside my apartment when the building shook. It sounded like an earthquake. It took me off guard and I couldn't find the front door,"" said Jody Ellington, who was home at the time.

In the past, when ICE agents release people into the community without properly vetting their backgrounds or providing them with the resources they need to avoid becoming victims of violence or exploitation, the public tends to think the immigrants are bad"

"It was only a few short months ago that I wrote a column for this site in which I made the argument for the idea that the 2014 NBA draft should be decided by the All-Star Game rather than by the draft lottery, since there would be more incentive to get good players at the draft lottery than there would be to get them in the game. I still feel that way. However, with the first two days of the draft lottery underway, there are several intriguing cases to be made that point in a different direction than what I suggested in my piece.

First up was the case for a team picking no. 4 or no. 5 in the lottery to try and move up and pick no. 2 or no. 3 to ensure they would be picking a good player. It would be an intriguing case for any team to be considering. However, what it also brings up is a point I made last week in an attempt to explain the differences between a good team and a great team, which are all of a sudden even more relevant given the fact that the New York Knicks and Sacramento Kings are both great.

The first point I want to make about the lottery and how the All-Star Game would impact the NBA is that, while the lottery has been"

Real estate app Buck's Place just announced the release of their first app update which allows users to receive alerts when the seller of their home has ""completed the transaction"". This will give them an opportunity to negotiate the sale or possibly offer a lower price if the price is low enough.

"If you are a woman or man with a history of mental health problems, your doctor should have your name, birth date, gender and social security number. This will enable them to make a note on a record, or a letter, in a doctor's clinic that the person in question is receiving treatment for a mental illness. This information can also be recorded in a doctor's note if it is part of a medical treatment.

When your doctor gets this information from your GP or from an NHS or private clinic, they may not always record your name and the name you were born with. Sometimes this will happen automatically when the patient registers their details in a medical record. If the information is recorded on the record, the patient is entitled to have a copy made, in case it needs to be kept.

However, your doctor should make the records as complete and accurate as possible. For example, if the doctor does not know whether or not the person you are seeking treatment from is living alone, the doctor should ask you for this information. If you don't know what address to send this information to, then they should tell you.

It is also worth telling your doctor whether or not you have been a victim of a crime. The police might not"

"A few weeks back I posted this video from an event I did last year on my podcast: ""What Is It About Being Transgender that is so Damn Difficult to Explain"". It is one of those conversations I wish I would have had years ago when I was just getting into it, and I know it probably seems a little naive. The only thing that makes sense at this point, if you have spent time reading my blog posts on this subject, is that being trans is something that just comes naturally to us, but we need to come up with a way of explaining it that we can both understand, and be okay with. I am hoping that I have done just that.

For those who are new to the discussion, or have not heard of this particular topic before, the general premise is that being transgender is an orientation. That is, that there is a gender identity that is intrinsic to who we are. If you're unfamiliar with that term, the idea of an orientation is that a person can be attracted to or not attracted to certain things. So if you were to have a ""gaydar,"" or if you were born with an innate preference for blue and purple, that would be a gender identity orientation, but not necessarily an orientation in a binary way"
"In an unprecedented move, the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC, has passed a resolution declaring ""support"" for a controversial state-level ""Right To Work"" law, which could cripple labor organizing and further de-unionize public-sector unions across the U.S.

ALEC's support of Wisconsin's controversial law was made possible in large part by the financial support of the National Federation of Independent Business, or the National Association of Manufacturers.

ALEC is an umbrella organization for more than 200 state lawmakers from all 50 states that write model legislation, often using it as a blueprint for federal legislation. ALEC also supports a ""model"" education law at the federal level and recently sponsored a meeting to draft the ALEC-backed ""Right To Work"" legislation, which would undercut union rights across the country.

The resolution states:

Whereas, ALEC is a non-profit organization comprised of state legislators from around the country, whose purpose is to create and support model legislation, to be used at the state level, for the advancement of free markets, limited government and federalism;

"As the debate about gun violence heats up, some in Congress are calling for an armed police officer on the streets. But not everyone is buying it. (Whitney Shefte/The Washington Post)

The National Rifle Association's response to last month's school massacre in Connecticut, when a gunman killed 26 children and adults before turning the gun on himself, is an obvious one: armed guards.

The organization has advocated for an armed, trained police force at the nation's schools since at least the late 1980s. The proposal was first introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), then a member of the NRA and now a senator and potential 2016 presidential contender, in 1995, during the Clinton administration, and was promoted as part of a larger call for a federal mandate on armed guards at all American schools.

""It would be a very important step forward if the federal government could simply make that commitment,"" Cornyn told a gathering of the group's lawmakers in 1996, according to The Post. ""And if the state and local governments are able to come in and make it happen, it will be a good thing.""

In the ensuing years, the proposal was rehashed repeatedly in Congress, including by Democrats who were hoping to be"

As the debate rages on in the UK and the US over whether to introduce a universal basic income, some experts in the field are warning against making such a policy an inevitability.

As a means to guarantee a basic income, universal basic income has some serious advantages, says Sarah Glover, director of the UBI Initiative, an organization based in Toronto that advocates for universal basic income. But, she says, ""there is also a risk of unintended consequences of universal basic income.""

Glover's argument is based on research from a 2016 report, which shows that, as with most new technology, basic income may make things worse. In fact, basic income has been used in certain areas, such as Alaska and Finland, to eliminate poverty, and improve public health.

Basic income may have unintended consequences

EDMONTON -- An Edmonton police officer who was filmed tasing a teenager on a public transit bus in October was convicted Thursday of assault and disorderly conduct.

The judge found Constable William Mah told a 17-year-old passenger in the video he had better get out of the way, which the officer later admitted to in his own account.

Mah also used profanities during the encounter that left the teen with a bruised eye and swollen lip.

""The video does not support the theory of Constable Mah that the accused was the instigator or had anything to do with the assault,"" said Justice Sean Harrington, who also ordered Mah to complete 240 hours of community service and pay the teen's costs.

The video, shot by the teenager on his cell phone, showed Mah shouting and cursing at the passenger, who had the right of way, the judge said.

The victim's father testified earlier Thursday that his son suffered from asthma and his family was distraught.

The question is not what kind of instrument to get, but rather which kind you should get. I'm a firm believer that any good guitar should have a few different kinds of strings to suit its temperament. There are three main kinds of guitar strings, but they aren't strictly right or left. In fact, most acoustic guitars have three or more varieties.

Right: The first and most obvious kind of guitar string is nylon, and is the string you're more likely to encounter on an acoustic guitar. These are usually a soft and flexible variety that you'll use in combination with your fingers, like you would on an acoustic guitar. Nylon strings have a higher resistance to stretching and vibrating, and will require you to take care of your instrument to prevent any damage from this. Nylon strings will be easier for your instrument to string along with other nylon strings. They are also less likely to be affected by the vibration of your fingers as much, so they can be played more lightly. Nylon strings also come in different gauges.

"In this post, we'll talk about some of the common pitfalls to avoid while programming and how you can overcome these pitfalls in the future. We will focus on the three most common errors that come up during a Python code development cycle, which we'll refer to as:

Error #1 – Bad Input

Error #2 – Too Much Information

Error #3 – Syntax Error

Before we get started, I would like to remind you of two very important concepts when developing any programming language. These are the Python's syntax rules and the Python's programming style. The Python's syntax rules define the way Python's operators work and define what a particular syntax can and can't be used for.

Python's Programming Style describes how we write our programs in a consistent fashion, using only the features of the language we know. These two things will be key in determining what our program should look like and how it should work.

When programming, we always make sure we know what our code should look like and what it should do before we begin to write it. In addition to the above two concepts, you will need to use good style to help your program write itself, or in other words, the way you program in Python. Good"
"The new era of the N64

by John Keating

A N64 Classic -

A New Generation

In 1994 Nintendo launched a new era for the N64 console. They announced their intention to launch the new generation of their popular video game system by introducing a new generation of hardware. Nintendo 64 was the first video game console that had been released for the entire generation. It had been a long time coming and with the introduction of the 64DD (Disk-Based Entertainment Device) by Nintendo, it had finally been ready for prime time. The new N64 was to be a truly modern and revolutionary video game system, not only because it featured a 32-bit processor (as compared to the 16-bit processor that the SNES was using), but because of its revolutionary hardware and software design.

The hardware and software architecture that would make up the new 64-bit hardware would make up a big part of the console. Nintendo would have the new 64DD attached to their 64DD controller and have their games be played by simply pressing a button on the controller and using the built in software.

Nintendo would also launch their own hardware in the form of the Super Nintendo. They were hoping that the new hardware would help them take"
"As part of my new project ""A Modern Approach To The Art Of Programming"" (part of my ""The Art of Programming"" series) I wrote a Python module for implementing a simple game, ""Game of Life"", as a game in C. The C implementation is actually fairly simple and only does the minimum to implement the basic functionality: the player can move a little, the board can be resized and the game is played using an in-game program that prints a list of moves every turn. However, the Python implementation has several significant benefits, and it also allows us to play the game on our laptop without any difficulty. The game can be played by several players simultaneously, the game is quite interesting (not just to look at), and it can be played even faster with a relatively small set of functions.

The module contains an implementation for the ""move"" function which is responsible for updating the game board in place. The board is initialized and populated by calling a function named move which is defined as follows:

def move (self): print ""Hello from C! Move 1, Left to "" + str (self.grid) + "" and Right to "" + str (self.grid[0])

If you've been around the web for the past few years, you may have seen that the open source software movement has grown immensely over the last five years. Open source software (OSS) has grown from being a niche area to an industry unto itself, and companies like Facebook and Microsoft are embracing the benefits of OSS by releasing their entire source code into the open source community.

As with anything open source, there are many different flavors of open source, and this article is not a complete guide on how to get started with any particular OSS. We recommend you read up on what OSS means to you, as well as the specific project that you would like to use in the near future.

Here is a list of the most popular open source software, which will serve as a reference when reading on this site:

Note: Some of these projects are still under development or still have their code locked to a specific project, so there is still more work to be done in each.

"""I can't even fathom it, and it makes no sense to me,"" says an irate Joe Domanick of his local newspaper's coverage of his fight over a $250 parking ticket. ""I think we need to go back to a more basic idea, and that's to take people by their rights.

""You've got the right to speak to a lawyer if you feel aggrieved, to file an appeal,"" he says. ""The paper didn't have the guts to do it.""

Domanick and a few others had filed complaints against a newspaper, The Tribune, and its parking enforcement officer for ""wrongful imprisonment"" for parking his patrol car in the wrong spot on the evening of Sept. 9, 2010, according to a letter they wrote to the editor and the police department.

In response to Domanick and a handful of others' complaints, The Tribune agreed to conduct a random spot-checking of its parking meter revenue during a few weeks of the fall. It didn't like the results.

According to Domanick, the city had made a ""grotesque mistake,"" because the meter was only being read when there was no other vehicle parked. He said his wife, who had left him"
"In the mid-1930s, as a result of a massive financial crash and a new wave of political radicalism, the Italian Communist Party (PCI) split into two groups: one led by a group of intellectuals who would soon become known as the ""red fascists,"" and another that included members of the middle and working classes, known as ""green fascists."" The new party's founder, Enrico Cattaneo, would become an important ally of Mussolini and eventually be elected president of Italy, in 1934, only to be ousted after just five years in office, when the Italian military would seize power from him and arrest him in February 1939. Cattaneo would later write:

The Social Democracy and the trade-union leaders did everything in their power to sabotage my party and the government and to create the illusion of an impending defeat. But it is clear that my party won the day by a majority vote in the National Council in September 1938. This victory, which is so much more significant in view of the conditions of the time and the position of my party, was due entirely to my political abilities, not to the influence of any outside forces. The Social Democratic Party and the trade unions had to bow down before me or be eliminated"
"""He's going to go after it like the devil's on fire. And I believe in God's will.""

It was the opening line from an interview Donald Trump gave to CBS News on February 8. It was also the beginning of an epic back-and-forth that Trump and CBS's John Dickerson engaged in on the air over the course of more than five hours, during which Dickerson asked about a slew of Trump-related subjects, including a question about his charitable contributions and his support of the Republican nominee.

Then, a couple of hours later, Dickerson asked a follow-up.

""Are you going to release your taxes?"" he asked, as part of a larger segment about the presidential debates. ""I'm interested to know: Did you pay income tax in some form during that time?""

Dickerson had followed up his previous questions by asking a series of questions on topics like whether Trump has paid any federal taxes and how many employees he had on his payroll during that period of time.

""Well, you know what?"" Trump replied, with an air of surprise in his voice. ""I'm going to give you the most honest and unfiltered answer as possible, which I've never given before"

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — The Supreme Court on Monday refused to consider whether President Donald Trump's third attempt at a ban on visitors from several majority-Muslim countries should be allowed to move forward, a blow to the White House.

In an order, the justices denied the Trump administration's request to allow a lower-court ruling in Hawaii blocking the ban to take full effect.

Trump had signed his first travel ban in late January. But a federal appeals court blocked its enforcement last month, saying Trump lacked the authority to ban travel from some of the most heavily regulated nations on earth.

Trump had appealed the decision, but Monday's ruling is likely to provide Trump with"
"""In a way it is an allusion to the great drama in the lives of the great heroes of our time: the rise and fall of a dynasty and the fall of a dynasty."" – H.L. Mencken

For nearly six years, the New York Times has been the newspaper that's covered the ""crisis of the middle class."" This week it took another stab at explaining this phenomenon in an article called ""The Great Divide."" It was written by Richard Reeves, the chief executive officer of The Times Co., and David Leonhardt, the Washington bureau chief for the newspaper. In it, they described what they see as the two extremes of American politics – one of them a Republican Party that has lost the interest in the working class, the other a Democratic Party that is abandoning the middle class to pursue policies that benefit the wealthy.

It's a compelling story that, unfortunately, isn't accurate. In the first part, Reeves and Leonhardt describe what they think has happened to America's economy in recent decades. They have an economy in which median income for full-time, full-year workers has been dropping, falling for eight years running and dropping an average of nearly four percentage points per year since the late 1990s.

"The story of the most famous female killer in modern times begins with an unusual confession. In September 2009, the daughter of one of the country's most notorious killers admitted to the murders of nine people, all women, during the 1980s, as the FBI began a new probe into his crimes. The confessions, from an inmate at a California state prison, are detailed in the latest chapter of a bestselling book by David E. Kelley, ""The Girl Next Door.""

""This book is an attempt to get to the heart of a complicated crime,"" Mr. Kelley told me recently in an interview at his home in Connecticut, where he has written two previous books on crime, one, ""A Dark Place,"" in 2008, and a sequel, ""The Girl Next Door,"" in 2010. He was referring to the crime that made his wife and himself famous: the kidnapping and murder of nine women and the dismemberment and torture of five other victims at his remote, woodsed estate near Carmichael, Calif.

Mr. Kelley has long believed that he has uncovered a mystery that will shed light on the many unanswered questions surrounding his father's crimes. But it is only in his new book, Mr. Kelley said, that he has succeeded in explaining ""why"

"""If we go by the number of victims, I would say it's the biggest mass-scale sexual abuse in our history,"" says Professor Pauline Cafferkey.

""And yet it's been hushed up.""

Cafferkey is the chair of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, set up after a string of high-profile abuse scandals rocked the Church.

""What is being suppressed is a history of institutional sexual abuse,"" she says.

The first step of the inquiry is to review the evidence in order to find out exactly how many victims there are.

It's estimated that between the 1950s and 1990s, about a third of Australian children were sexually abused.

In that period, about 40,000 priests and other people associated with them were convicted.

""That's a number which, if you are looking for a statistic that would indicate that you had an epidemic of abuse in your midst, this would be a number to which you'd point,"" Professor Cafferkey says.

She says that in many of those cases the Church failed to report suspected child sexual abuse.

""The evidence suggests that a substantial proportion of priests were not reporting, and certainly if we are to look"
"Bachelor in Paradise contestant Zeke Smith was arrested for assault Thursday and was taken to jail after being charged with two felonies, according to jail records.

According to an arrest warrant obtained by TMZ, Smith allegedly kicked an employee and a security guard after being escorted to a private area of the Paradise Island hotel, which was not accessible to guests. Smith allegedly pushed security guards when they attempted to remove him from the room, and the security guard said Smith threw an ice cream at him, TMZ reports.

Smith, 26, is currently out on bail but is scheduled to return to jail for the second felony, which is domestic battery, according to TMZ. Smith's bail is currently set at $100,000.

Smith, who appeared in a previous episode of Bachelor in Paradise, was originally placed in jail in a misdemeanor complaint from April 2016. That complaint alleged Smith and his then-fiancé, Taylor Armstrong, attacked the former girlfriend of former BIP cast member Brian Wade.

After that incident, Smith and Armstrong allegedly stole a vehicle from a storage facility, but were stopped by police in a road rage incident. They allegedly took off after being stopped.

Bachelor in Paradise was filmed in Fiji from early February to late August"
"If you are a member of a fraternity, you will know what it means when your name is called in a crowd.

""I got it,"" a person in the crowd might shout as they see you walking up to them, the best example of what fraternity men call each other in public.

A new study is looking at just how important your fraternity affiliation is to the way you're perceived.

A research team at the University of Rochester found that people's impressions of fraternity brothers depend on what the members look like and what the members' surnames are.

In the study, which will appear in an upcoming edition of the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science, participants watched videos of men with different facial characteristics, such as smiling, frowning and smiling again.

""When you see somebody, you're not just thinking, 'What is this person doing?'"" says Dr. Stephen C. Kosson, one of the researchers on the project. ""You're also thinking, 'What do these features tell me about them?'""

The researchers found that, even when the people in the videos looked just like any other fraternity member, they were viewed more favorably by viewers if the man had the same or a similar facial shape.

"In an article for the Wall Street Journal, Harvard professor Steven Pinker argues that we are living in a new age of mass ignorance, with the public losing their grasp on ""basic truths"" like evolution.

This is the new ignorance: The mass-misleader of a society has replaced the lone-wolf mass-murderer, but it's a lot easier to manipulate an ignorant mass of people. It is an era when people are too uninformed, and their collective memory too short, to find and expose a hoax, but a great many are still vulnerable. The hoax has a voice. And if we are to survive it, it must be our own.

""When you see an error, correct it. If it is a simple one, and not the sort that requires much reasoning, or a complex one, explain it,"" Pinker writes. ""But when people can't identify basic truths, you should ask them. If they can't, ask yourself.""

I've noticed that people who are deeply involved in the field of evolutionary psychology don't understand that ""basic truths"" can be defined and discovered through a scientific approach. And this is a problem that needs to be addressed.

To put it another way: Evolution"
"Marijuana legalization activists, including former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld, are slated to meet in Boston on Sunday, Aug. 7.

The Massachusetts Coalition to Regulate Marijuana released the list of speakers who are scheduled to participate.

Wise, a former Republican and Republican gubernatorial nominee who lost to Gov. Charlie Baker in 2006, has been a staunch advocate of legalizing and taxing marijuana. In November, Weld's Marijuana Policy Project and the Marijuana Policy Project Action Fund launched the Marijuana for All Act in Massachusetts. The proposed law would create a system to regulate marijuana like alcohol by setting up a marijuana control commission that would have authority to license businesses. The commission would have regulatory authority over all marijuana establishments, including growers and processors. It would have the power to license growers to operate in specific locations in Massachusetts and allow them to cultivate a certain number of marijuana plants in those locations. It also would require a new regulatory board for marijuana distributors and allow the board to establish regulations for retail stores and cultivation centers. The legislation would allow patients to buy marijuana from one of four new marijuana retail stores.

In November, the group won support from former Gov. Mitt Romney to form the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, or Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol. It was founded by"
"""We will do what we can to keep them as long as possible. And when that is not possible, then we will move on.""

President Obama on Tuesday urged his fellow Democrats in the U.S. Senate to put aside their differences to pass a bipartisan health care reform bill that would keep the government open past Oct. 1.

In a speech in the White House briefing room, Obama said the GOP has spent more time working to block health care reform than in promoting the law itself. He called on Republicans to show some bipartisanship.

""If there were a bill to pass right now, that would keep us on schedule, we could vote right now,"" Obama said.

But the president's plea appeared to come after Democrats and Republicans were still negotiating how the government's finances will be managed in the months after the Nov. 6 elections. The Obama administration has warned that the health care bill could have the effect of putting off spending cuts that were already planned.

""There is a real concern about whether it will actually make up for some of the cuts that will have to occur as a result of sequestration, for instance,"" the president said.

He also said it was a good thing for the GOP to"
"In the middle of a presidential campaign that is about the only thing that seems to interest Donald Trump, a story out of The Post claims the presumptive Republican nominee's team was actively exploring whether his rival Hillary Clinton could face criminal charges over her private email server.

""Trump aides and advisers have been asking whether Clinton will face criminal prosecution and are looking at the possibility that she did, in fact, violate the law,"" writes Robert O'Harrow Jr., who is a longtime political reporter and is writing a book on the 2016 race. ""In recent months, they have also discussed the political damage to Clinton and the possible fallout from her decision to use a private server,"" writes O'Harrow, a former editor of The New York Times Magazine.

Trump and his team have long insisted there's nothing illegal about using a private server to conduct government business and have frequently made statements that suggest he'd like to move past the issue, though the latest claim suggests Trump and his aides are considering legal action against his former rival if she ends up indicted.

A lawyer for the Trump campaign did not immediately return a request for comment."
"""The big difference is the number of people and the kind of money,"" she said, adding that her party would do much better at the ballot box in 2018 if she becomes governor.

In the past three decades, there has never been a Democratic nominee who was better positioned to run against Mr. Christie than Mr. Booker.

Mr. Christie's approval ratings, for example, remain in the 40 percent range — a far cry from the 61 percent he enjoyed before Mr. Christie entered office and a low even by the standards of his rivals. He has had no major policy successes since entering office and, for a long time, has struggled to be heard above the cacophony of criticism coming from both parties.

The New Jersey Democratic Party has a history of endorsing Democratic governors. But, for a while, Mr. Christie was its favorite to win in a general election — until the day after the governor announced he was not seeking reelection.

Democrats in the state were still hoping Mr. Booker, the state's junior senator and a rising star in the Democratic Party, would become a candidate.

After Mr. Christie announced in March that he would not seek re-election, he called on New Jersey voters to send him to Washington as"

"In a recent blog post on the Apple Support Communities website, the company outlined new privacy features for iOS 8 that include an optional setting for ""do not disturb"" mode. The feature is not turned on by default and is activated only for those with iOS 8.0.1, 8.0.2 or 8.1 devices.

If a person in your household chooses to turn ""Do Not Disturb"" on for a specific iPhone, iPad or iPod, all alarms in that device are disabled until you go to Settings -> General -> Notifications & Dock and switch it back to ""Do Not Disturb"" mode.

"Bastrop County District Attorney Abel Reyna is now investigating the circumstances of a man who died after a violent altercation at a Texas mosque last weekend.

A video that captured the altercation went viral. It showed a man kicking the man as he lay on the floor and police were called to the mosque in Bastrop County. The man had a cut to the head and a gash in the throat, according to witnesses.

Rescue personnel rushed him to an emergency room but the man was pronounced dead a short time later, according to officials. The man who was kicked died. The other man who was punched was released.
